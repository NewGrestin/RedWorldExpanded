Yet, when we start looking at it from a national or even a global perspective, the capitalists are far too few to do the same with the workers of the world.

They're spit on by the middle class for their low status and pressured by the higher classes, seeking to push every penny out of the little man.

  RWE_GRL_Hawkeye_Problems:0 "Thorns on the Rose"
  RWE_GRL_Hawkeye_Problems_desc:0 "Iowa was a founding member of the Great Lakes Federation, which was founded in the aftermath of the American collapse as a way to secure the existence of the Midwestern style of life. One of the main members of the Federation, Iowa has always been considered one of the four cornerstones, alongside Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. However, it has been decades since the initial foundation of the federation and the situation has changed drastically. \n\nThe once moderately liberal and progressive Farmer-Labor Party of Paul Wellstone has become the Democratic Alliance and the popular progressive populist has now been replaced with Melissa Hortman, a far less moderate figure than Wellstone. Especially in Iowa, Hortman has been rather unpopular for her centralization effort, her focus on more socialist policies and her environmentalist stance. \n\nFor many in Iowa, the federation is seeming to turn rotten. Progressive liberalism has now made way for socialism and the stable federation is turning into a centralized republic. Iowa, however, holds onto the special power it holds in the federation: its veto. A thorn in the side of the Hortman administration, Iowa has consistently vetoed Hortman's motions in parliament and continues to do so untill a less left-wing figure becomes president of the federation, which currently seems unlikely. As the power of the socialists in the Democratic Alliance and the influence of the IWW grow, Iowa has started seriously reconsidering their position in the federation. Perhaps it is time to make amends and leave, as nations like Illinois and the Midwest Union show more promise than Hortman's social authoritarianism." 
  GRL_Corn_Belt:0 "Our Lovely Corn Belt"
  GRL_Corn_Belt_desc:0 "As one of the many successor states of the old United States, the Great Lakes Federation inherited half of the famous Corn Belt: a region rich in agricultural produce and, due to technological advancement in the field of agriculture, one of the most fertile regions in the world. While fewer than 10% of the people are employed in the agricultural sector, wheat, corn and soy still bring tons to the treasury every year. Exporting to many other American states, the Great Lakes can be considered the beating heart of this new America, selling their corn to the hungry while living in agricultural luxury." 
  GRL_Democratic_Alliance_Dominance:0 "Democratic Alliance Dominance"
  GRL_Democratic_Alliance_Dominance_desc:0 "The House of Peers in Milwaukee shines in a bright pink for over 10 years now, as the Democratic Alliance continues to hold the clear majority of seats in the House. While the 2009 presidential election was only won by a slim margin for Hortman, the House was won with ease. \n\nThis situation is relatively new for the federation, as the 10 years of DA dominance followed over 20 years of Farmer-Labor Party government. However, under Wellstone, the F-LP united with the remnants of the Democrats and the Social Democrats, formalizing the new Democratic Alliance that would win in a landslide with Wellstone in 2001. Since then, the party has shifted between progressive and socialist views, with Hortman being the most recent shift towards the left. \n\nWhile the party dominates the House, inner stability must be maintained. The Wellstone-progressives remain sceptical of Hortman's more socialist policies, while supportive of her centralization effort. While the Alliance remains dominant in our political landscape, a series of missteps could weaken its position, giving the old Republican Party of DeVos and the Libertarians their chance to potentially break the pink hegemony of the House."

  grl.1.t:0 "Iowa Governor threatens Seccession" 
  grl.1.d:0 "The recent tension between Iowa and the federal government has reached a boiling point this week, as Iowa governor Chuck Grassley has threatened president [GRL.GetLeader] with the seccession of the state of Iowa if the government is unwilling to step down over their involvement in the IWW support scandal. Iowa, never having been the most loyal state of the federation, has generally been relatively bothersome during votes, but this recent threat from governor Grassley has shaken up the House. \n\nWhile our lawyers are currently working out if seccession is an actual legal threat, Hortman has come public in denouncing Grassley's attempt at a threat. In one of the most tense events in Great Lakes history, Hortman has to keep calm and see what the future brings." 
  grl.1.a:0 "Will Grassley act on his words?" 
  grl.2.t:0 "Grassley meets with Illinois President"
  grl.2.d:0 "A few weeks after the threat from Iowa, governor Grassley has flown to Saint Louis and met with sitting president [ILL.GetLeader]. While it was a relatively uneventfull talk between the two Americans, the press release has created a storm back in Milwaukee. If the papers are to be believed, the Iowa governor amusingly joked about the unification of Iowa with the federation of Illinois, something which was met with a similairly joyful response from the Illinois president. While far from an official agreement, this kind of banter so soon after threats of seccession have ruffled the feathers of the federal government, which now demands an explanation from Grassley. \n\nGrassley has already responded, asking the government to \"suck it up\" and stop complaining about what he perceived to be nothing more than an ironic joke. Whatever the actual feelings between Illinois and Iowa may be, this doesn't bode well."
  grl.2.a:0 "Can a joke turn into a promise?" 
  grl.3.t:0 "Iowa Guard Mobilized"
  grl.3.d:0 "Papers across the federation report about the shockwave that shook the pillars of the federation this morning, as the Iowa governor has decided to mobilize the Iowan National Guard for seemingly no reason. No response has come from Des Moines and the few Republican Iowa representatives in the House have been pressured by Hortman and the government to answer on the recent happenings in their homestate. While they all seem to be unaware of what has actually happened in Iowa, most of them have refused to denounce the sitting governor for his actions. Milwaukee stands at a crossroads, as the House is becoming less and less cooperative on this issue." 
  grl.3.a:0 "What is Grassley thinking?" 
  grl.4.t:0 "Stand-Off at the Iowa Border"
  grl.4.d:0 "Reports from the Iowa border are flooding in, confirming our worst nightmare: Grassley seems to be serious about his threat of seccession, demanding the government to step down as quickly as possible. Iowa soldiers have turned back visitors from other states at the border while temporary defensive positions have been build near the interstate highways. \n\nWith the tension rising in Milwaukee, Hortman has to take decisions. She can either try and keep the currently semi-hostile House together and try and strike a deal with the less radical republicans, potentially starving Grassley from a supporters base, or she can disband the House, which would give her more time to mobilize the army and respond to this threat of federal sovereignty. There's no clear answer to this paradox, but Hortman will have to decide." 
  grl.4.a:0 "Disband the house now and get me a camera!"
  grl.4.b:0 "Contact the Republican Party, talks will secure the nation" 
  grl.5.t:0 "Iowa joins Illinois"
  grl.5.d:0 "The worst case scenario has been realized, as Iowa has taken matters into its own hands and has joined the state of Illinois. Illinois troops are now moving into Iowa, as Grassley greets them as liberators. \n\nThis gross violation of Great Lakes Federation sovereignty cannot be tolerated. The army stands ready and the paramilitaries have been contacted. Hortman, in her last adress to the nation before the war, informs the people of the situation. \n\n\"People of the Great Lakes, the situation has become dire. Iowa and the Republican Party have betrayed our glorious federation and have given Iowa to the enemy in Illinois, violating our basic sovereignty in an illegal move of opportunism. As we currently speak, the federal army has moved to our border with Illinois and the word has been given to them. If all things go according to plan, federal boots will be on Illinois soil in 30 minutes. \n\nAs long as you can, tuck your kids into bed, contact your loved ones and family and kiss those closest to you. the Great Lakes Federation is at war\"."

  grl.7.t:0 "Iowa betrays the Revolution"
  grl.7.d:0 "With the revolution in the Great Lakes in full swing, the state of Iowa has declared its intent to separate itself from the newly declared people's republic in Milwaukee. This betrayal of the revolution can not be tolerated, but the instability so soon after our revolution has left us no choice but to let the state go. \n\nIowa has agreed to become a part of Illinois' small pact with Missouri, forming a tri-state confederacy in the heart of the former United States."
  grl.7.a:0 "The Iowan worker will be liberated after the revolution"
  grl.8.t:0 "Milwaukee IWW declares a Strike"
  grl.8.d:0 "Recent decisions by the Hortman government to not increase the minimum wage in the docking sector has triggered a response from the IWW this week, as the dockyard workers trade union have collaborated with other infrastructural unions and declared a city-wide strike. As transport and trade comes to a grinding halt, the government has scrambled to come with a response to the situation. \n\nMembers of the liberal fringe of our party seem to not spare any sympathy for the strikers, having proposed to wait the strikes out. Eventually the IWW can sustain these strikes for a limited period of time, leaving them vulnerable to a classicc game of chicken. However, many members of the alliance are far less willing to ignore the strikes. Many of them seek to strike a deal with the strikes, potentially increasing the minimum wage in the sector to get them back to work. Members of the opposition, however, have been far more blunt in their proposal, seemingly prefering to send the military to deal with the strikes and end the strikes quickly."
  grl.8.a:0 "Wait the strikes out"
  grl.8.b:0 "Strike a deal with the strikers"
  grl.8.c:0 "Send the military police to deal with them" 
  grl.9.t:0 "Milwaukee Strikes seek our Support"
  grl.9.d:0 "The recent tyranny of the faux-socialists in Milwaukee have triggered a response from the labor unions in the region. In the capital of Milwaukee, dockyard and railway workers have protested the government by striking, demanding an increase in their minimum pay. With the IWW trying to sustain this fire of revolution, the chapter in the Great Lakes has knocked on our doors, seeking support from the American People's Commonwealth. We can help them sustain this ember of revolutionary spirit, or we can send them away without the monetary support and/or food they need."

  grl.10.d:0 "In another display of agitation, the Commonwealth of the East Coast has supported the strikes of Milwaukee, extending the period of time the IWW can sustain these strikes and directly hindering our economic development. It once again shows us the intentions of Philadelphia, as they have no intention to support their left-wing comrades in the Americas, instead opting for revolutionary agitation and undermining our fragile democracy."

Stating among its reasons the improving quality of life of common citizens of the federation and the stability the federation has experienced, the academic approval can be critical in swinging the younger student votes. However, some do fear that if they ever turn their backs on us, that we will have to deal with the consequences of losing the academic and/or student vote."
  grl.11.a:0 "We can accept their approval with open arms!"

  grl.12.t:0 "Police shoot Protesting Worker"
  grl.12.d:0 "News from Minneapolis has taken the nation by storm, as an active duty police officer shot one of the workers protesting against recent local mining regulation. The injured worker was rushed to the nearest hospital, but died several hours later due to complications post-injury. With this incident, the police of Minneapolis is under heavy scrutiny by the local farmer-labor DA government and the worker-rights groups. Republicans, on the other hand, have defended the police, stating the danger of the situation and trying to shift the blame to the IWW and the riots it had caused."

  grl.13.t:0 "Minneapolis Court rules in favour of Big Mining"
  grl.13.d:0 "Today, the conclusion of the court case against the Great Lakes Mineral corporation ended in civil outrage, as the court of Minnesota proclaimed their verdict in favour of the mining corporations represented by Great Lakes Minerals, damaging the right of miners to 30 minute breaks during holidays. This conclusion has been met with outrage by the IWW and the DA and the High Court will most likely decide upon the future of this verdict."
  grl.13.a:0 "The high court upholds the verdict"
  grl.13.b:0 "The high court opposes the verdict" 
  grl.14.t:0 "Reforming the Prison System"
  grl.14.d:0 "As a fairly local epidemic of the flu has broken out in Michigan prisons this week, the federal parliament has been busy on the topic of potential prison reform. Despite the fall of the United States, the prison complex born during the 20th century continues its tradition of incarcerated labor nationwide. With the flu outbreak and the repeated pressure from the IWW to liberate the prison workers, the DA has adopted a moderate stance on prison reform, seeking to improve living conditions for inmates and expanding the healthcare capabilities of these prisons. Republicans, on the other hand, have decried these reforms as \"being soft on hardened criminals\", often forgetting to mention that many of these \"hardened criminals\" are currently in prison for relatively minor crimes, such as repeated shop lifting, not murder or grand theft. Yet, their though on crime stance remains popular in many rural counties, so there's still the option to keep reform on the shelves."
  grl.14.a:0 "Radical reform is needed, abolish incarcerated labor"
  grl.14.b:0 "Improve the living conditions for inmates"
  grl.14.c:0 "We can probably just shelf the issue for the time being"
  grl.15.t:0 "Return to Basics"
  grl.15.d:0 "\"The recent course of the Great Lakes federation has done it's name shame. The centralization effort under the Democratic Alliance and president Hortman has damaged the communities of our nation, polarizing them and pushing the boundaries of the power of the presidency. With her administration now gone, our government seeks to actively reverse her course and return powers to the local governments of the federation. Our glorious federation is made up from the 4 states that rejected the radical course of Washington, let's not fall into the same trap as Reagan did and return to the basics\". \n\nThe televised adress to the nation of [GRL.GetLeader] was met with intense criticism, but also with intense enthusiasm. The return of federalism has begun."
  grl.15.a:0 "Restoring the federation is the most important thing right now..."
  grl.16.t:0 "The Responsibilities of the States"
  grl.16.d:0 "Our proud federation is made up from 4 different states. When we first separated from the failing USA, we held onto the system that was given to us by its founders, adopting a system of local autonomy that helped the people of the states adress the issues of the states, while keeping the power of the federation bound by extreme rules and laws, only allowing interference when absolutely needed, such as the violation of the constitution and the rights of the Great Lake citizens. Yet, with Hortman and her regime came centralization and immense greed. Power was syphoned off from the people and into the presidency, turning it into an absolute seat of power. \n\nWe have thus recently passed legislation bringing many federal and presidential issues once more into the hands of the states. Protests outside of the parliament have appeared, mainly fearing a repeat of Jim Crow and suspicious of this debate on \"state rights\", but [GRL.GetLeader] has made it very clear that this new course should not be considered a return to the era of segregation, but instead a truthfull adoption of the original constitution of our Founding Fathers, one that was lost with the fall of the old United States and the tyrant-like actions of Hortman."
  grl.16.a:0 "A return to normalcy..."

  grlnews.1.t:0 "Revolutionaries seize Milwaukee"
  grlnews.1.d:0 "The recent instability in the Great Lakes Federation has seemingly culminated to disaster, as the labor union-rich region now faces revolution. With the IWW and the CPUSA chapters of the region forming a collective fist against [GRL.GetLeader], the fragile federation is on the brink of civil war. Already, the government has instated a curfew and has mobilized the national guard to seize the opportunity to crack down on these revolutionary groups. \n\nThis new revolution has tensed up relations between the American statelets once again, as the American Republic and Illinois support the Milwaukee government, while the APC and UAPR have publicly confirmed their support for the Milwaukee revolutionaries. \n\nThe current situation mainly seems to be concentrated on the coastline of the federation, but the sheer numbers of this new united front of revolutionaries may spell the end to the old Great Lakes Federation, throwing another piece of America into the inferno of communism."

  grlnews.2.t:0 "Crusade for the Soul of America"
  grlnews.2.d:0 "The fall of the United States has left the world in a crazy state, yet nothing can be considered even close to as crazy as the recent news out of Milwaukee, now the seat of the recently proclaimed Kingdom of the Israelites and its head, Carey I. With the establishment of this theocracy on earth, Carey I and his knight templars have proclaimed a new crusade, one that will define the very soul of America. \n\nAccording to the Milwaukee monarch, the United States has always been the fabled Kingdom of the Isrealites that needed to be rebuild for the eventual return of Christ. Yet, before the Lord could return to earth, the Soviet satanists destroyed the nation from within with the support of communists, socialists, fascists and capitalists. With the fabled kingdom now in shambles and the people of \"christian America\" divided, Carey I has proclaimed it his divine duty to bring the pieces back together and bring the Kingdom of God to earth. \n\nThe statement from Milwaukee has been swiftly met with condemnation from the Vatican."
