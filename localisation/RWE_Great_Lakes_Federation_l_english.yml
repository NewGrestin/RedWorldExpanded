  GRL_Break_the_Chains:0 "Army of Wobblies"
  GRL_Break_the_Chains_desc:0 "Our future is never secure. As long as people oppose the worker, the worker will have to organize themselves into defensive collectives and communities. While the IWW doesn't need a standing army, it can learn its members how to fight off reactionaries and capitalists. Give the Wobblies a gun and let them fight those boot-loving sons of bitches."
  GRL_One_Big_Union:0 "One Big Union"
  GRL_One_Big_Union_desc:0 "To be divided is to follow the conspiracy of the capitalists. One capitalist can control a small union, as he can hold his breath longer than the union members. Yet, when we start looking at it from a national or even a global perspective, the capitalists are far too few to do the same with the workers of the world.

May the tyrants of America tremble!"

  GRL_For_the_Union_Makes_Us_Strong_desc:0 "The Socialist Rifle Association has been an incredible asset to the IWW during the revolutionary days in Milwaukee. However, as the issue of unification returns, we will have to see if the members of the SRA are willing to serve their comrades once more. With their expertise and our ambition, it may not be the pie in the sky it seemed once."

  GRL_Invite_French_Organizers_desc:0 "Despite the boot of Moscow on the throats of many of their workers, the people of France remain remarkable in their ability to unionize and cause trouble. We've written letters to their leadership in Paris, hoping to get some of those in the French IWW chapter with the experience needed to properly coordinate our members." 
  GRL_Expand_National_Union_Activity:0 "Encourage Union Formation"
  GRL_Expand_National_Union_Activity_desc:0 "With the old government overthrown, the workers of the Great Lakes are free to unionize. However, anti-union sentiment remains strong in some parts of the country. Thus, our government has to actively encourage the formation of labour and trade unions in these regions, hoping to get the people on board with the idea and come up for their rights against their exploitative employers."
  GRL_Secure_Worker_Rights:0 "Blue-Collar Rights"
  GRL_Secure_Worker_Rights_desc:0 "Blue-collar workers are the most exploited class in American society. They're spit on by the middle class for their low status and pressured by the higher classes, seeking to push every penny out of the little man. With the IWW at the helm of our country now, the blue-collar worker will have his rights to fight back against capitalist exploitation. For the union makes us strong!"

  RWE_GRL_Hawkeye_Problems:0 "Thorns on the Rose"
  RWE_GRL_Hawkeye_Problems_desc:0 "Iowa was a founding member of the Great Lakes Federation, which was founded in the aftermath of the American collapse as a way to secure the existence of the Midwestern style of life. One of the main members of the Federation, Iowa has always been considered one of the four cornerstones, alongside Michigan, Minnesota and Wisconsin. However, it has been decades since the initial foundation of the federation and the situation has changed drastically. \n\nThe once moderately liberal and progressive Farmer-Labor Party of Paul Wellstone has become the Democratic Alliance and the popular progressive populist has now been replaced with Melissa Hortman, a far less moderate figure than Wellstone. Especially in Iowa, Hortman has been rather unpopular for her centralization effort, her focus on more socialist policies and her environmentalist stance. \n\nFor many in Iowa, the federation is seeming to turn rotten. Progressive liberalism has now made way for socialism and the stable federation is turning into a centralized republic. Iowa, however, holds onto the special power it holds in the federation: its veto. A thorn in the side of the Hortman administration, Iowa has consistently vetoed Hortman's motions in parliament and continues to do so untill a less left-wing figure becomes president of the federation, which currently seems unlikely. As the power of the socialists in the Democratic Alliance and the influence of the IWW grow, Iowa has started seriously reconsidering their position in the federation. Perhaps it is time to make amends and leave, as nations like Illinois and the Midwest Union show more promise than Hortman's social authoritarianism." 
  GRL_Corn_Belt:0 "Our Lovely Corn Belt"
  GRL_Corn_Belt_desc:0 "As one of the many successor states of the old United States, the Great Lakes Federation inherited half of the famous Corn Belt: a region rich in agricultural produce and, due to technological advancement in the field of agriculture, one of the most fertile regions in the world. While fewer than 10% of the people are employed in the agricultural sector, wheat, corn and soy still bring tons to the treasury every year. Exporting to many other American states, the Great Lakes can be considered the beating heart of this new America, selling their corn to the hungry while living in agricultural luxury." 
  GRL_Democratic_Alliance_Dominance:0 "Democratic Alliance Dominance"
  GRL_Democratic_Alliance_Dominance_desc:0 "The House of Peers in Milwaukee shines in a bright pink for over 10 years now, as the Democratic Alliance continues to hold the clear majority of seats in the House. While the 2009 presidential election was only won by a slim margin for Hortman, the House was won with ease. \n\nThis situation is relatively new for the federation, as the 10 years of DA dominance followed over 20 years of Farmer-Labor Party government. However, under Wellstone, the F-LP united with the remnants of the Democrats and the Social Democrats, formalizing the new Democratic Alliance that would win in a landslide with Wellstone in 2001. Since then, the party has shifted between progressive and socialist views, with Hortman being the most recent shift towards the left. \n\nWhile the party dominates the House, inner stability must be maintained. The Wellstone-progressives remain sceptical of Hortman's more socialist policies, while supportive of her centralization effort. While the Alliance remains dominant in our political landscape, a series of missteps could weaken its position, giving the old Republican Party of DeVos and the Libertarians their chance to potentially break the pink hegemony of the House." 

  GRL_Stability_Grand:0 "Federal Stability: §GGrand!§!"

  GRL_Stability_Okay_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Federation is currently relatively stable. The people enjoy their lives as domestic terrorism, civil unrest and more are relatively unheard of in our great federation. While we may have some political troubles here and there and while some people are still born with less opportunity than others, our federation is at the very least stable and functioning" 
  GRL_Stability_Questionable:0 "Federal Stability: §YQuestionable§!"
  GRL_Stability_Questionable_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Federation has started to wobble on its foundations. While people can still go outside and enjoy life, the nation currently experiences a serious case of violence and unrest. Domestic terrorism has started to plague our cities again as the far-right and other extremists seek to end our little nation and political problems have gridlocked the federation."
  GRL_Stability_Threatened:0 "Federal Stability: §GThreatened§!" 
  GRL_Stability_Threatened_desc:0 "The Great Lakes Federation is weeping, as stability is now a historic luxury we cannot afford any longer. Domestic terrorism, civil unrest, riots and seccesionist sentiment are all a plague on our nation and we'll have to deal with it sooner than later if we want our little nation at the Great Lakes to survive this decade."

  grl.1.t:0 "Iowa Governor threatens Seccession" 
  grl.1.d:0 "The recent tension between Iowa and the federal government has reached a boiling point this week, as Iowa governor Chuck Grassley has threatened president [GRL.GetLeader] with the seccession of the state of Iowa if the government is unwilling to step down over their involvement in the IWW support scandal. Iowa, never having been the most loyal state of the federation, has generally been relatively bothersome during votes, but this recent threat from governor Grassley has shaken up the House. \n\nWhile our lawyers are currently working out if seccession is an actual legal threat, Hortman has come public in denouncing Grassley's attempt at a threat. In one of the most tense events in Great Lakes history, Hortman has to keep calm and see what the future brings." 
  grl.1.a:0 "Will Grassley act on his words?" 
  grl.2.t:0 "Grassley meets with Illinois President"
  grl.2.d:0 "A few weeks after the threat from Iowa, governor Grassley has flown to Saint Louis and met with sitting president [ILL.GetLeader]. While it was a relatively uneventfull talk between the two Americans, the press release has created a storm back in Milwaukee. If the papers are to be believed, the Iowa governor amusingly joked about the unification of Iowa with the federation of Illinois, something which was met with a similairly joyful response from the Illinois president. While far from an official agreement, this kind of banter so soon after threats of seccession have ruffled the feathers of the federal government, which now demands an explanation from Grassley. \n\nGrassley has already responded, asking the government to \"suck it up\" and stop complaining about what he perceived to be nothing more than an ironic joke. Whatever the actual feelings between Illinois and Iowa may be, this doesn't bode well."
  grl.2.a:0 "Can a joke turn into a promise?" 
  grl.3.t:0 "Iowa Guard Mobilized"
  grl.3.d:0 "Papers across the federation report about the shockwave that shook the pillars of the federation this morning, as the Iowa governor has decided to mobilize the Iowan National Guard for seemingly no reason. No response has come from Des Moines and the few Republican Iowa representatives in the House have been pressured by Hortman and the government to answer on the recent happenings in their homestate. While they all seem to be unaware of what has actually happened in Iowa, most of them have refused to denounce the sitting governor for his actions. Milwaukee stands at a crossroads, as the House is becoming less and less cooperative on this issue." 
  grl.3.a:0 "What is Grassley thinking?" 
  grl.4.t:0 "Stand-Off at the Iowa Border"
  grl.4.d:0 "Reports from the Iowa border are flooding in, confirming our worst nightmare: Grassley seems to be serious about his threat of seccession, demanding the government to step down as quickly as possible. Iowa soldiers have turned back visitors from other states at the border while temporary defensive positions have been build near the interstate highways. \n\nWith the tension rising in Milwaukee, Hortman has to take decisions. She can either try and keep the currently semi-hostile House together and try and strike a deal with the less radical republicans, potentially starving Grassley from a supporters base, or she can disband the House, which would give her more time to mobilize the army and respond to this threat of federal sovereignty. There's no clear answer to this paradox, but Hortman will have to decide." 
  grl.4.a:0 "Disband the house now and get me a camera!"
  grl.4.b:0 "Contact the Republican Party, talks will secure the nation" 
  grl.5.t:0 "Iowa joins Illinois"
  grl.5.d:0 "The worst case scenario has been realized, as Iowa has taken matters into its own hands and has joined the state of Illinois. Illinois troops are now moving into Iowa, as Grassley greets them as liberators. \n\nThis gross violation of Great Lakes Federation sovereignty cannot be tolerated. The army stands ready and the paramilitaries have been contacted. Hortman, in her last adress to the nation before the war, informs the people of the situation. \n\n\"People of the Great Lakes, the situation has become dire. Iowa and the Republican Party have betrayed our glorious federation and have given Iowa to the enemy in Illinois, violating our basic sovereignty in an illegal move of opportunism. As we currently speak, the federal army has moved to our border with Illinois and the word has been given to them. If all things go according to plan, federal boots will be on Illinois soil in 30 minutes. \n\nAs long as you can, tuck your kids into bed, contact your loved ones and family and kiss those closest to you. the Great Lakes Federation is at war\"."

  GRL_IWW_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nThe IWW and its Wobblies have done what some would have considered impossible mere months ago: they've overthrown the Great Lakes government and reinstalled a new, union-based government with the IWW at its head. \n\nWith the IWW now cementing its power, the new Great Lakes Union looks across the Great Plains. America is divided and the worker is oppressed by big dollar, Soviet-sympathisers and mental patriots. The IWW can not stand by and watch this travesty, as we have a moral obligation to use the contacts we have and undermine these tyrants of capitalism, soviet-ism and fascism."
