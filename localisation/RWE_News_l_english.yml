newsrw.1.d:0 "20 years after his first hit release, \"The Day Marx Predicted\", professor Francis Fukuyama has finally released a spiritual sequel to his first hit, called \"History never Ends\". In his new book, Fukuyama argues that his initial predictions for the future were, in fact, wrong. Where in his first book he tries to argue in favour of a communist end of history with the collapse of the United States, in his new book, Fukuyama contradicts his first predictions, arguing that \"history never truely ends\", as seen in the new counter-movements that have grown in the communist world. Citing the new national bolshevik wave and the trends ongoing in the Middle East as potential destabilizing factors for global communism and potentially even allowing for a return to liberal, capitalist democracy. \n\nThe book, despite its succes as a best-seller in Europe, Asia and the Americas, has been scrutinized by many. Some see it as a subversive piece that undermines communism, while others still seem to hold on to the idea that Fukuyama is a crypto-communist after his first hit book."

newsrw.2.d:0 "A few days after French has followed the Italian example and publicly announced that the refugee situation had become a crisis, the French general-secretary of the Communist Party, Alain Bocquet, has given his letter of resignation to the National Assembly, ending 10 years of stable, yet underachieving, government for the French Socialist State. \n\nIn his letter, Bocquet argues that he has become tired of the stress put on his shoulders as general-secretary, trying to bring France through a decade of uncertainty and slow reform, following the Moscow-style of governance. Yet, with the continued stagnation of the economy, the infighting in the party and the recent refugee crisis, the stress put on Bocquet has been too much for him and his health, leading to his decision to resign from his position as general-secretary. \n\nWith this news, France now prepares for the coming party congress, during which a new general-secretary will be elected."

newsrw.3.d:0 "In a surprising twist of events, Marine le Pen, leader of the new nationalist outlook movement of the French Communist Party, has been able to amass enough support to win the general-secretaryship. Not only has she become the first female head of governments of the French socialist state, but also the first of this national outlook faction of the party. \n\nLe Pen has become a controversial figure for many, due to her explicit flirting with far-right concepts. Especially her ideas of French identity and refugees have attracted criticism from the party, seeing it as an explicit subversion of the equality mentality that communism seeks to promote. Yet, despite her controversy, Le Pen remained popular among the people, far more so than the mainstream faction of former secretary-general Bocquet. \n\nBesides her domestic policy, Le Pen also has attracted attention for her foreign policy, one that is explicitly adopting a risk-based strategy as a way to cement France's position in the EU and the Warsaw Pact, which could be disastrous for both organisations."

newsrw.4.d:0 "Despite the urging of the party leadership and even the more direct tone of the military, which ended years of work on the military's apolitical public image, Lionel Jospin, co-leader of the reformists of the Communist Party, has won the general-secretaryship of the French Communist Party. \n\nLionel Jospin is an interesting member in the long history of the Communist Party. Initially joining the party as a more radical member of the Trotskyist faction, Jospin slowly turned more moderate as the decades went on. In the 1990s, as Gorbachev became prominent in the Soviet Union's Communist Party, Jospin adopted a similair ideology to Gorbachev, believing that true communism could only be achieved in a more liberalized state, rid of the bureaucracy and authoritarianism of the orthodox mainstream and adopting a more relaxed approach on the road towards socialism. Despite the fear from the party and the army of a subversion of the French revolution, Jospin still won a majority and now rules the French socialist state as its first reformist general-secretary."

Winning her seat in the national assembly in 2002 representing Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, she soon made a name for herself by joining Jospin's reformist movement. Bringing the topic of sustainability and environmentalism to the mainstream and the party, Duflot has attracted a large support base of environmentalists in the party. In 2009, she finished her magnum opus with the Federation of European Greens, the first pan-European ecological movement campaigning for a more ecological approach to central planning. While the party seems afraid of her reformist tendencies, the people have truely fallen in love with his green-fingered reformist."

newsrw.6.d:0 "Reports from France seem to indicate a shift in the old Communist Party, it being one of the oldest communist organisations in Western Europe, as the old orthodox mainstream has choosen to be represented by a far less orthodox man, known by the name of Jean-Luc Mélenchon. \n\nOnce a proud member of the moderate reformists, Mélenchon's candidacy for the orthodox party line came as a surprise to many. A once so vocal opponent of the rigid bureaucracy and limited vision of the party joining the faction that embodied those exact problems. Yet, some believed that Mélenchon had truely moderated his ideology. Like a fine wine, perhaps Mélenchon wasn't as sharp as his younger self, leading to his nomination not just winning the orthodox leadership, but the general-secretaryship as a whole. \n\nAs part of his moderation, Mélenchon has generally advocated for small steps on economic reform and making bigger steps regarding France's position in the world, seeking to establish France as an equal partner to Moscow and overshadow Berlin in the EU."

newsrw.7.d:0 "In a rather unsurprising turn of events, Patrick le Hyaric, prominent member of the European Federation of Humanitarian Marxists and the Communist Party in France, has won the general-secretaryship with a landslide. The party leadership has already congratuled Hyaric with his victory, as the streets of Paris turn red with the flags of protestors. \n\nA man of many ambitions, yet tamed by the party line, Hyaric has been considered one of the more dissapointing members in the race for the general-secretary of France. A member of the orthodox mainstream of the party, Hyaric's platform generally advocated for the expansion of the French welfare state and continueing the close ties France has had with Berlin and Moscow as a loyal ally in the war against capitalism. His rethoric, while popular among the older voters, has met criticism from academics and younger voters, which led to the massive protests in Paris this week. Many see Hyaric as another cog in the party's machine and demand his immediate resignation and replacement with a more ambitious leader."

newsrw.8.d:0 "The recent victory of Maxime Gremetz has turned heads across the world. A man known for his authoritarian thinking and devotion to the revolution, Gremetz can only be considered the most dangerous part of the stagnating status quo France has to offer. \n\nGremetz isn't a popular figure in the party, yet represents the most ultra-orthodox side of it. Advocating the establishment of a more Soviet-style system in France and approving of the Polish government's actions undertaken to crush the opposition, his thoughts have often been the point of anti-communist propaganda used by reactionary resistance in France to paint a picture of the communists as devout stalinists, able and willing to redo the things they've done in Hungary and Poland if needed. Gremetz, meanwhile, has often decried these pieces of propaganda as traitor-like subversion. Yet, even the party leadership is unsure what to think about Gremetz. Will his actions help the revolution forward, or jeopardize it?"

newsrw.9.d:0 "After hours of silence from the government, French general-secretary [FRA.GetLeader] has confirmed what had been speculated: the French military had initiated a coup d'état attempt and failed miserably. Yet, despite its failure, the coup has still shocked France to its very core. \n\nA traditionally loyal force to the party, the French army had been sidelined by the ascension of Jean-Luc Mélenchon to general-secretaryship. Shortly after this, Mélenchon openly questioned the role of the army in political decision-making, breaking with the silent truce between the party and the army since the '90s. This fed into anger among military members of Mélenchon's less orthodox practices, leading to the planning of the coup. \n\nYesterday, the coup attempt was executed. French soldiers left their barracks and tried to occupy Paris, but were stopped by regiments still loyal to the regime. A whistleblower ruined their plan and left the coup leaders with their pants down, leading to their arrests and the failure of this careless, yet shocking coup."

newsrw.10.d:0 "Today, in an unilateral declaration of independence from Nouakchott, the new Mauritanian government has declared itself an independent entity from the West African Union. The declaration has been met with anger from the Union itself, kickstarting the Mauritanian War of Independence. \n\nThe mostly Arab-speaking country of Mauritania has always been the odd sheep of West Africa, yet the spark for this conflict did not originate from the Arab ruling class of the country itself, but from the failure of the recent May Day coup in the West African Union. Partially defeated by the federal armies but still with a large following, many of the coup loyalists fled to Mauritania under the banner of Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz and formed an alliance of convenience with the extreme ba'athist ruling party of Mohamed Yahdhih Ould Ibrid El Leil. This coalition of Arabs and military conspiracy supporters would soon lead to the federal government closing down much of Mauritania and introducing the curfew to the province. However, their effort was not enough to properly contain the situation."

However, the more recent decisions made by Mélenchon \"forced the hand of the army\", according to Pierre de Villiers, the temporary president of the French Salvation Government. Him and other members of the high command have been able to muster a large part of the military to their cause, though an equally large chunk of those loyal to the communist revolution continue to follow Mélenchon and the Paris government. It remains uncertain whom of these two Frenchman will define France's future."

This large-scale logistical mission has led to the end of the civil war that rocked France, but has started a new, awkward period of diplomacy in the Mediterannean. \n\nWhile now stuck on the troublesome island of Corsica, the French military still claims to represent all of France proper. The French Socialist State, on its part, has been unable to occupy Corsica with the large military presence, yet still claims it as a territory of France. This situation is made extra bad due to the situation of Corsica itself, with the natives of the island rallying behind the Corsican nationalist FNLC, an organisation responsible for various terrorist attacks. With the new military presence on the island, experts believe that the violence on Corsica will only worsen, especially with the support Gadaffi has given the group in the last decade."

Alongside the rebels, representatives of SWAPO and various ethnic minorities spoke out against the South African government, even going so far as to announce their support for the African National Congress.\n\nNow on the backfoot, the South African Army has begun operations to reclaim Namibia and pacify the local rebellion. Complicating the situation is the international response, as many neighboring African nations have thrown their support behind either side, raising concerns that the Namibian War may soon escalate into an overt regional conflict."

The move to crush the general strike previously evoked unrest from the other ethnic republics of Yugoslavia, but the complete failure of the YPA to resolve the situation has further exacerbated tensions. In the void left by the Yugoslav authorities, elements of the Kosovar Liberation Army have seized control of urban centers and declared the independence of the Republic of Kosovo.\n\nThe declaration comes as a shock to the Yugoslav government, which has unilaterally condemned the declaration as illegal. Despite their best efforts, however, it seems the pin on the proverbial grenade has been pulled. Mass protests have erupted in Slovenia and Croatia, with counter-protests by the Serbian minority in the latter. While the YPA continues to fight against the Kosovar separatists, the rest of the Balkans can only watch and wonder how the situation will develop next."

Mladić, a Bosnian-Serb, has made it clear his intention to protect the Serbian minority in Croatia and Kosovo, realizing the fears of Serbianization that the ethnic republics held for the last decade.\n\nYugoslavia, now reorganized under the Yugoslav Preservation Committee, now faces the looming threat of total dissolution. Even elements of the Serbian League of Communists have denounced Mladić and rallied behind the previously suppressed democratic parties. Other elements of the League have joined with Serbian nationalists, abandoning the pretense of Yugoslavian unity in favor of preserving Greater Serbia. The Balkan powers of the Warsaw Pact continue to loom over the developing situation, with Albania expressing concerns about the YPA's actions against ethnic Albanians in Kosovo. It remains to be seen if Moscow will intervene in the rapidly degraging Yugoslav conflict."

Seeing the worst fears of Serbianization come true, Bosnian forces have quickly mobilized to put down the rebellion, a decision that has rapidly escalated tensions with Yugoslavia.\n\nBosnia's conflicts have expanded further with the introduction of Croatia into the war, whose leadership has seen an opportunity to seize Croat majority provinces of Bosnia in the chaos. Almost immediately, Bosnia proper has found itself divided politically between the remnants of the League of Communists and democratic forces, while Islamist fighters have arrived in the country to begin the fight against the Serbian combatants."

Čanak's government has found support from Hungary, as the newly born nation contains a sizable Hungarian minority.\n\nHungary's support brings, by extension, the unspoken support of the Warsaw Pact. Romania and Bulgaria have both announced concern regarding the situation in Yugoslavia, with Bulgaria notably arming Macedonian separatists, likely in an effort to undermine the Yugoslav government's control in the region. While a full scale intervention seems unlikely at the moment, the gradual increase in involvement from Warsaw Pact nations has drawn concern in the Yugoslav Republics, with many fearing intervention and imposition of Soviet Communism."

The Greater Serbian Front has claimed itself as the successor to Yugoslavia, intending to reunify Serbia with her irredentist claims across the Balkans.\n\nDespite his retreat from Belgrade, Mladić has refused to take this development lying down and has rallied his remaining allies to defeat the Serbian ultranationalists and restore order.

Perry's victory came with a definitive shift in the party, with a greater emphasis on placating the Christian conservative elements.

The Act would, if passed, constitutionally prevent the office of the President from unilateral executive decisions without Senatorial suppport. Clearly targeted at preventing another bout of martial law, the act is just one part of Paul's dramatic effort to downsize the Texan government.
