  nation_of_islam_thought_desc:0 "The beliefs and ideas of the Nation of Islam, despite it being a form of Islam, are far removed from the traditions and ideas of mainstream Islam. Centralized around the leading minister, the Nation of Islam believes in the inherent superiority of black people, all of whom are descended from the earliest humans, the Arabic-speaking, dark-skinned Tribe of Shabazz. Caucasians, on the other hand, were not created by Allah but by an evil scientists known as Yakub as a test for the Tribe of Shabazz and their children, testing their inner divinity. The Nation of Islam also believes that the current Allah will soon return to earth on a \"Mother Ship\", wiping out the white race and bringing an utopia."

  RWE_NAF_Decentralized_Movement_desc:0 "Our movement has historically been one of many organizations without one, central organization. African-Americans from across the political spectrum may now be united in their task against white supremacy in the South, but New Afrika remains far from an united movement. Ranging from black nationalists and conservatives to black maoists and communists, not even mentioning the more controversial members of this big tent alliance such as the Nation of Islam, the New Afrika alliance is anythign but centralized. \n\nYet in this decentralized movement lies perhaps our biggest strenght. The African-American fighting for New Afrika may have any ideological belief, but all are atleast united against a common enemy, namely those that seek to infringe upon our rights. May New Afrika survive to become an independent country or seek reunification of the old United States, one thing remains certain: we won't go out quietly."
  RWE_NAF_Flight_to_New_Afrika:0 "All-American Justice Volunteers"
  RWE_NAF_Flight_to_New_Afrika_desc:0 "The plight of New Afrika has become a story told from sea to shining sea, with hundreds of African Americans hearing about those brave enough to fight oppression and white supremacy in Dixie. Yet it doesn't just remain at prayers and sympathies, as thousands of African-Americans, Caucasians, Hispanics and Asians come to New Afrika, hoping to volunteer and fight for a just cause. These All-American Justice Volunteers, as they are now known as, have taken up their arms against the unstable tri-state confederacy."
