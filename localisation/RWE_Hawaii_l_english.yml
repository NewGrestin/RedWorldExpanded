  RWE_Hawaii_Tourist_Trap:0 "Jewel of the Pacific"
  RWE_Hawaii_Tourist_Trap_desc:0 "Hawaii is one of the biggest success stories of the Dissolution of the United States, emerging as an admittedly small but economically viable and stable Post-American nation. The modern Hawaiian Republic maintains a position as a major hub of trade in the Pacific, helped significantly by her cordial relationship with Australia and Canada, whose citizens form a critical backbone of the tourism industry.\n\nThe country's tropical locale and stability have allowed it to flourish, expanding and diversifying the economy into the financial and gambling sectors. At the same time, this economic boom has allowed the rapid development of a strong middle class, helping to maintain the momentum of Hawaii's economic growth. The only true restrain the nation faces is cost of living, as the islands still require imports from the outside to maintain themselves, though many administrations have attempted to tackle this issue with varying success."
  RWE_Hawaii_Diversity_Quota:0 "Cultural Melting Pot"
  RWE_Hawaii_Diversity_Quota_desc:0 "The Republic of Hawaii is a diverse nation, with significant influences from Asia and Native Hawaiians. Prior to the Dissolution, Hawaii maintained the highest percentage of Asian-Americans of any American state, which has only grown since independence. Hawaii's population is overwhelmingly made up of Asian-Americans, predominantly Filipino Americans and Japanese Americans, along with the Native Hawaiian population.\n\nThe diversity of the Hawaiian Islands has helped to greatly bolster relations with other Asian nations, particularly bringing in valuable trade and political support from Japan. Notably, Hawaii also maintains a large population of Korean and Vietnamese expatriates, much of the former having resettled across Asia and the Pacific following the fall of the South Korean government.\n\nThis degree of preexisting diversification, coupled with the American emphasis on constitutional order and personal liberty, has created a unified society that is greater than the sum of its' parts."
  RWE_Hawaii_USN_Remnants:0 "Memories of the Pacific Fleet"
  RWE_Hawaii_USN_Remnants_desc:0 "Hawaii was a major outpost of the United States Navy prior to independence, and the chaotic events of the Dissolution lead to a significant amount of the Naval assets to simply choose to remain in Hawaii. The Hawaiian Government has since left most of the largest ships in port, decommissioning several to be repurposed as museum pieces.\n\nMany of the smaller support craft could be reused as part of the Hawaiian Coast Guard, while former Naval specialists found themselves quickly scooped up as consultants for the Hawaiian government. Though the country lacks the capacity to field a navy of the same scale as the Pre-Dissolution United States, the technical expertise and practical experience of former USN personnel has proved extremely helpful in keeping the Republic safe."
