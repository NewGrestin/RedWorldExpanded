  RWE_OKL_Future_of_Oklahoma:0 "Future of the Sooner State?" 
  RWE_OKL_Future_of_Oklahoma_desc:0 "The disunification of the American Republic has left Oklahoma in a delicate position. A small, rural and impoverished state in the middle of the former US, Oklahoma has to pull itself up if it wants to survive the new geopolitical situation. As the marxists of the East and West Coast consolidate and the alt-right in Idaho and Montana start to unify, Oklahoma has to look abroad to find peace and prosperity. Untill then, our future remains uncertain at best." 
  RWE_OKL_Rural_Poverty:0 "Sweeping Rural Poverty"
  RWE_OKL_Rural_Poverty_desc:0 "As the corner of the deep South, Oklahoma has never been the center of attention, either economically or politically speaking. The 1980s decimated our local economy and the following dissolution of the United States under Ronald Reagan worsened the situation to a point of sweeping rural poverty. Small farmers have to work to live day by day, while only a few are wealthy enough to sustain the big farms. \n\nEven under the South-oriented American Republic, Oklahoma remained a backwater with many of its young minds fleeing to Atlanta, New Orleans and Dallas. With more and more people leaving this small state of ours, it is no wonder that our crippling poverty continues to dominate local affairs, as finding a job is now like finding a diamond."

  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_desc:0 "As the conservative corner that Oklahoma is, the little statelet has become a prime target for the widespread menace that is white supremacy in the former United States. Organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, have organized campaigns of terror, trying to infect the people of Oklahoma with fear and using false flag attacks to provoke a race war in this little nation of ours. \n\nAs the influence of the KKK grows in Oklahoma, our government has to act against this immoral clan of racists and preserve the liberal democracy that shines in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and any other Oklahoman city. For the American way of life is not something up for debate." 
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_1:0 "Angered the Klan"
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_1_desc:0 "Recent government policy has substantially angered the KKK, leading to an expansion of the already big terrorist campaign it has held since the inception of Oklahoma. One silver line: the expansion of the terror campaign has destroyed any public good will the KKK previously had."
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_2:0 "KKK Exodus" 
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_2_desc:0 "With the recent anti-racism bill pushed through the house, the KKK has been officialy branded a hate group and has been forced to disband the organization. While some white nationalists continue to operate in the shadows, many of the former KKK members now flee to the Proud Patriots and the conservatives."

  # EVENTS

  oklahoma.1.t:0 "Oklahoma seeks our Protection"
  oklahoma.1.d:0 "The recent dissolution of the American Republic has left the former republican territory scarred by small statelets. Oklahoma, being one of the most impoverished statelets on the American continent, has also been birthed out of this event and now seeks our protection, fearing the march of the communists, fascists and national bolsheviks across the nation. They now seek our protection, as Texas will always be the bigger brother of Oklahoma."
  oklahoma.1.a:0 "Give them our blessings"
  oklahoma.1.b:0 "Nah, we don't care about Oklahoma"
  oklahoma.2.t:0 "Texas doesn't Care"
  oklahoma.2.d:0 "Our message to Texas made zero impression on the Texan leadership and a swift response confirmed that Texas wouldn't invest in protecting Oklahoma in the coming years. Alas, perhaps we have to look elsewhere?"
  oklahoma.2.a:0 "Dissapointing"
  oklahoma.3.t:0 "The Oklahoma Petition"
  oklahoma.3.d:0 "Recent affairs in the United States has left the people of the former American Republic without protection against the communist threat. Where the Republicans once held the nation together, now only little statelets fight amongst eachother. One of these new states is Oklahoma, a little democracy that shines above the rest. Despite its crippling poverty, Oklahoma seeks to join the Democratic League, hoping to be protected against the threats of extremism across the former United States."
  oklahoma.3.a:0 "Oklahoma is our little budy!"
  oklahoma.3.b:0 "Sorry, but we have bigger fish to fry"
  oklahoma.4.t:0 "Our Application Denied"
  oklahoma.4.d:0 "Our petition to Canada has come with a quick response, as Canada informs us that it has no intention of allowing Oklahoma to become a part of the democratic league, citing the fear of instability in the Oklahoma system and other major problems in our state."
  oklahoma.4.a:0 "Dissapointing"
  oklahoma.5.t:0 "Oklahoma Elections"
  oklahoma.5.d:0 "The exciting race for the House of Representatives is finally coming to a close in Oklahoma, as the people now decide who to elect as the leader of the nation for the next 5 years. The main contenders in this election are Joseph \"Exotic\" Schreibvogel of the Libertarians and Constance N. Johnson of the Young Democrats of Oklahoma, a splinter from the previously minor Democratic Party of the American Republic. While most don't expect them to win, the Proud Patriots of Rick Saccone remain a wildcard in this race, syphoning votes from the national conservatives and their supposedly lousy leader. Saccone's personality has dominated Oklahoma televisions for months now, captivating many Americans with his promises of reunification and a return to a \"Greater America\". For his part, Joseph Schreibvogel has responded to the Proud Patriots with similair promises, while Johnson has remained adament about Oklahoma sovereignty and doing away with the \"Americanist fever\"."
  oklahoma.5.a:0 "Joseph Schreibvogel and his Libertarians"
  oklahoma.5.b:0 "Constance N. Johnson and her Democrats" 
  oklahoma.6.t:0 "Proud Patriots Grow"
  oklahoma.6.d:0 "It's been mere days since the collapse of the old American Republic, yet the Oklahoma political scene has shifted immediately as a response to this new situation of sovereignty. Namely, Rick Saccone's Proud Patriots has made a surprising comeback after a few years of relative obscurity in Republican politics, syphoning votes from the meak and timid Oklahoma Unity Party, a splinter of the previous Independence Union. \n\nSaccone's loud personality has supposedly captivated many Oklahomans, seeing Saccone as a next Bush or Rumsfeld, here to save American democracy and restore the nation to greatness. While others have been far more sceptical about the bombastic ex-governor of Oklahoma, Saccone has refound his following these past couple days and has yet to see the end of his growing momentum."
  oklahoma.6.a:0 "A dangerous man for Oklahoman politics" 
  oklahoma.7.t:0 "Saccone claims Electoral Fraud"
  oklahoma.7.d:0 "It's been a few days since the results of the election have become public, but Rick Saccone has already gone on the offensive again. Dismayed about the results, Saccone has claimed that the election was flooded by electoral fraud by the ruling parties. \n\nWhile his claims have mostly been met with ridicule as they lack substantial evidence, Saccone has been able to mobilize a significant proportion of his voters on this electoral fraud issue. We may need to respond to this before it becomes a problem." 
  oklahoma.7.a:0 "Saccone is delirious, ignore him!"
  oklahoma.7.b:0 "We can investigate his claims if he really wants that" 
  oklahoma.8.t:0 "Saccone occupies the House"
  oklahoma.8.d:0 "Angered by the ridicule given to him, Saccone has taken drastic measures, with him and his supporters have stormed and occupied the House of Representatives. Reports remain unclear, but we believe that a few representatives were hurt and/or killed during the struggle. The temporary military forces are currently holding on stand-by, awaiting orders from the legitimate president. It's unclear if they are completely neutral on the issue, so only time can tell how this attack on our democracy will continue."
  oklahoma.8.a:0 "The army defects to the Patriots"
  oklahoma.8.b:0 "The army ends the House Occupation" 
  oklahoma.9.t:0 "KKK Coup"
  oklahoma.9.d:0 "It seems that the influence of the KKK was like a parasite, slowly poisoning Oklahoma from the inside. Today, the acting government has been caught with their pants down as the KKK marches through Oklahoma city. The sheer terror of this event is undescribeable, as the few international media outlets interested in the event refrain from filming the KKK and the destruction and death left behind by them. Occupying the House of Representatives while politicians are forced outside, Johny Lee Clary, leader of the Oklahoma Chapter, has declared himself the paramount leader of a new, white oklahoma. \n\nDemocracy is dead, the KKK now rules." 
  oklahoma.9.a:0 "The light of democracy has died down in Oklahoma"
