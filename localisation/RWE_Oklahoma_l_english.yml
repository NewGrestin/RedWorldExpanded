  RWE_OKL_Future_of_Oklahoma:0 "Future of the Sooner State?" 
  RWE_OKL_Future_of_Oklahoma_desc:0 "The disunification of the American Republic has left Oklahoma in a delicate position. A small, rural and impoverished state in the middle of the former US, Oklahoma has to pull itself up if it wants to survive the new geopolitical situation. As the marxists of the East and West Coast consolidate and the alt-right in Idaho and Montana start to unify, Oklahoma has to look abroad to find peace and prosperity. Untill then, our future remains uncertain at best." 
  RWE_OKL_Rural_Poverty:0 "Sweeping Rural Poverty"
  RWE_OKL_Rural_Poverty_desc:0 "As the corner of the deep South, Oklahoma has never been the center of attention, either economically or politically speaking. The 1980s decimated our local economy and the following dissolution of the United States under Ronald Reagan worsened the situation to a point of sweeping rural poverty. Small farmers have to work to live day by day, while only a few are wealthy enough to sustain the big farms. \n\nEven under the South-oriented American Republic, Oklahoma remained a backwater with many of its young minds fleeing to Atlanta, New Orleans and Dallas. With more and more people leaving this small state of ours, it is no wonder that our crippling poverty continues to dominate local affairs, as finding a job is now like finding a diamond."
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism:0 "White Supremacist Terrorism"
  RWE_OKL_KKK_Terrorism_desc:0 "As the conservative corner that Oklahoma is, the little statelet has become a prime target for the widespread menace that is white supremacy in the former United States. Organizations, such as the Ku Klux Klan, have organized campaigns of terror, trying to infect the people of Oklahoma with fear and using false flag attacks to provoke a race war in this little nation of ours. \n\nAs the influence of the KKK grows in Oklahoma, our government has to act against this immoral clan of racists and preserve the liberal democracy that shines in Oklahoma City, Tulsa and any other Oklahoman city. For the American way of life is not something up for debate."
