  RWE_MOT_Militia_Army_desc:0 "Seceding from the Midwest Union following the Dissolution of the United States, Montana is more of a coalition of militia groups than a state. Though Covington remains the figurehead of the Great Falls government, his rule is diffuse at best and heavily reliant on the country's myriad of militia forces.\n\nThese groups vary wildly in quality and quantity, and Montana has not been a beneficiary of many well-trained military leaders since the Dissolution. For the moment, veterans can be used to plug up the gaps, but reforming Montana's wannabe army into a genuine fighting force will require more political capital than the Covington administration can currently muster."

The lengthy, low intensity conflict was largely blamed on Covington's economic disputes with Spencer, whose white nationalist faction sought to emulate elements of Soviet planned economies. Despite officially being over, the guerilla war between the two statelets continues, although neither Spencer nor Covington are willing to commit to a full resumption of hostilities."

Rather than pursuing the reunification of America, Covington believes in the creation of a white supremacist state in the American Northwest, purified of the social rot of the former decadent United States. Covington and his loyalists believe it is the White Man's Burden to segregate themselves from the rest of America and, more importantly, purge their own lands of anyone who might try to bring down their dream."

  MOT_Raids_and_Illegal_Shit_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all of Covington's talk about purity of race, he wasn't exactly pure in the legal sense. Montana's heavy decentralization has allowed it to become a hotbed of illegal activity, from moonshining to methlabs, from gunsmiths to ganja farms. Covington, the fat useless idiot that he was, refused to tap into this market. Garrison is far less scrupulous. Montana must become wealthy and prosper if it's to remain independent, but more importantly Ben Garrison and his cadres must become wealthy and prosper. It's inevitable that America is going to turn into a war-torn hellscape, so might as well make enough money to pad the retirement fund before it all goes to hell.\n\nWe currently have £MOT_Money §Y[?MOT.Spendable_Money]§! million in Liquid Currency\n\nOur Current Monthly Income is £MOT_Money_Income §Y[?MOT.Monthly_Income]§!

  montana.1.t:0 "The North Awakens"
  montana.1.d:0 "The last few years have been particularly trying to the Montana Free State.\n\nOnce unified, we have been backstabbed by the Spencerite revisionists once again. Across the border in his so-called Union of Lincoln, Spencer plots to enforce his demented Marxist agenda on Montana's people. We are down, but we are not defeated. The state remains in the firm grasp of the Covington Junta, though our figurehead leader's grip may not be as tight as he thinks. Covington's rule is dependent on the approval of the militias, who have many of their own political aims.\n\nA handful of men have proven themselves to be contender's for Covington's throne. Ben Garrison, a populist leader of several militia groups, has proven more moderate than Covington. Normally such a revisionist would be prompty guided to the wall, but Garrison's less overt nationalism has won him support from locals, enough that Covington hasn't felt confident enough to have him shot. Yet.\n\nRandy Weaver is a similar issue, leading a faction referring to themselves as Sovereignists. Weaver's rhetoric could best be described as right wing anarchism, denouncing Covington for his infringement on states' rights and freedom. Weaver is more of an underground element, but left unattended could attempt a power play.\n\nThe most distressing group is the National Purists, lead by one Timothy McVeigh. An obsessive follower of the late William Luther Pierce, McVeigh's rhetoric is even more radical than Covington's, advocating for the racial purification of the entire former United States. Though thankfully kept far from power, McVeigh maintains a small but deeply devoted following.\n\nUltimately, all of this is contingent on marching across the border and putting Spencer's Marxist jewery up against the wall, as failing to put down his ambitious clique could leave us looking weak."
