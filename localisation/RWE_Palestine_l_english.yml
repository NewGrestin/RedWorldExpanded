 RWE_PAL_Only_Sane_Man_desc:0 "The Levantine Confederation of Palestine and the Autonomous Jewish Settlements is a beacon of stability and peace in a region fraught with conflict. Built on a historic compromise between Israel and Palestine, the state's decentralized model has helped to keep the Holy Land relatively calm for many years.\n\nThe Confederation's neighbors, however, are a very different story.\n\nThe United Arab Republic, vangaurd of the Nasserist revolution, appears increasingly unstable as Syrian nationalism grows uncontrolled in the North. Ba'athist Iraq and her tinpot leader Saddam Hussein loom as an ever-present threat to their neighbors. Unlucky Palestine, trapped between these outside forces, must stay the course and remain a bastion of pluralist democracy.\n\n§RIf Palestine were to fall to the forces of radicalism, the consequences for the Levant could be dire.§!"
