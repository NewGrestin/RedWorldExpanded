  RWE_WAF_Between_Two_Worlds_desc:0 "The West African Union sits on the edge of Africa and the Arab world, with in the north the Mauritanian Arabs and nomadic Tuareg people, while the south of the nation consists of a diverse bunch of African people. Yet, despite the international positives on being the gate to Africa and the Arab world for many other nations, the domestic situation profits far less from this fact. \n\nWhile formed as an union of equal nations, it is no surprise that some ethnic groups dominate the West African Union compared to others. The Bambara, Mossi, Hausa and the Moors all dominate their respective regions and form the main pillars of the elite supportive of the military junta of Maïnassara. With these dominant groups, the other ethnicities of the West African Union are not truely represented in the elite ruling the country. Yet, despite the already complicated mix of ethnicities that live in the Union, the ruling groups of the Union are not united either. \n\nAs the years have went on and the military junta has ruled our Union, the differences between the Arabic-speaking Moors of Mauritania and the non-Arabic people of the South have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Under the popular ba'athist groups of Mauritania, the Arab-speaking people of the Union have sought more and more self-determination, bordering on seccesion from the Union. Whispers in Niamey even talk about a military conspiracy among the Mauritanians, yet evidence remains scarce."
