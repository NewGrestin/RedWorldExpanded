 RWE_SAF_South_African_Apartheid_desc:0 "Under the presidency of de Klerk, South Africa continues to bolster its Apartheid regime, established in '48 with the first victory of the Afrikaanse National Party. Since then, South Africa's place in global politics increasingly came under scrutiny. While the '70s seemingly saw a return to normalcy for South African foreign politics as America sought to bolster its own influence in Africa, the collapse of the United States and the cementing of Soviet hegemony plunged Capetown once more into pariah status. We see ourselves buried once more under economic and diplomatic sanctions to the point of having only a few allies. Even our own sovereignty has came into question, as Warsaw regime after Warsaw regime recognize the illegal Republic of Azania and its government in exile, led by Nelson Mandela. \n\nDespite international sanctions, Apartheid remains in place and the local populace continues to be repressed by the white minority government of Capetown. As long as South Africa can stand against international pressure, it seems unlikely for the situation to change."

 RWE_SAF_Torchbearer_Against_Communism_desc:0 "During the decline of the United States, South Africa saw a sudden normalization of relations with the old Atlantic Treaty. As African state after state fell to Soviet influence, Washington D.C. needed a staunch ally on the continent with ideological commitment to remain out of the soviet sphere. South Africa, while far from perfect, was the only nation to properly represent the needed ally on the continent, as the National Party's vested interest in keeping communism at bay was perfect for a partner against Soviet expansionism. \n\nThe fall of the US has left us as a lone fighter on the African continent. Communism tries and fails to perverse our society and subvert the Apartheid system of rules, yet the Bureau of State Security (BOSS) monitors their activities across our territory. Communism won't be allowed in our Union."

 RWE_SAF_Facing_the_Dark_Continent_desc:0 "As the only true white minority government left on the Dark Continent, the Union of South Africa faces a relentless aggression from the native communist nations. They shun our existence and almost all only recognize Azania as the legitimate government of our territory. We have thus build up a military capable of planning with a serious African conflict, having drawn up contingency plan after contingency plan in the event of an invasion. The South African Union Forces will be capable for the next war it participates in."

 RWE_SAF_Under_The_Shield_Of_The_Atom_desc:0 "With our very existence being questioned, South Africa turned to a device many nations have turned to in similair situations. Its atomic program came out with success, as our secret '79 nuclear test in the South Atlantic went practically unnoticed. From then on, our budget has gone into expanding our nuclear arsenal and its short range capabilities, allowing for an immediate defense of our borders. \n\nVoices in the government have been vocal about expanding our pogram however. There's a particular belief that we should be able to threaten the entire region of Sub-Saharan Africa in the event of pressure being put on our nation, known as the §RRapture Doctrine§!. The existence of the Rapture Doctrine remains classified information, with only South Africa knowing its own capability to act upon such a doctrine. This situation keeps the region extremely volatile, as the mere suggestion of South African capability to wipe away the region is enough to worry about."
