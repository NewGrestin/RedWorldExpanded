RWE_POL_Comrade_Soldier_desc:0 "1983 was a dark year in the history of the Polish People's Republic. With its hands forced by the Soviet Union, the opposition and the internal agitators against communism, general Jaruzelski was forced to declare martial law across the entire territory of the people's republic, starting nearly 2 years of martial law. \n\nThe years of the Military Council of National Salvation did not help the economy, nor did it restore the trust of the Polish people in the people's republic. Food and other products remained scarce and distributed through foodstamps and the black market flourished. The opposition didn't cave either during the martial law and Solidarity remains a force to not be forgotten in the current civil system. With few things changing and a lot of problems remaining, the military council slowly reintroduced a semblance of democracy to the Polish People's Republic starting in 1988. Czeslaw Kiszczak was named prime minister by president Jaruzelski and a new \"democratic\" government was given form by the military council. In december 1988, the Military Council of National Salvation was disbanded and martial law suspended, starting the second period of communism in the Polish People's Republic. \n\nSince then, Jaruzelski has retired from his presidency but continues to influence the Communist Party in the shadows. Kiszczak, for his part, has tried to sustain the situation, yet the Polish People's Republic remains stagnating. Its economy is crawling along while the opposition has reorganized into a big tent of the original members of Solidarity to more right-wing ideologues. \n\nWe cannot accept the disintegration of Poland. Jaruzelski won't stand for it."
RWE_POL_Mismanagement_Economy:0 "\"Nothing Planned\" Economy"
RWE_POL_Mismanagement_Economy_desc:0 "The planned command economy style that Poland adopted from the USSR in the late 1940s has, to put it nicely, failed miserably. Since the '70s, even reforms to the system could not stop the economy from crawling at a glacial pace, leading to Poland losing the economic race against much of the recent communist nations of Western Europe and falling far behind in the Warsaw Pact. With the economy in stagnation, a black market for everything from normal products to highly illegal American products smuggled from the failing USA circulated through Poland. The failure of the command economy led to party reformists jokingly calling it a \"nothing-planned\" economy, while Poland fell deeper and deeper into economic stagnation. \n\nSince then, the economy has not recovered. The black market still has an enormous presence in Poland and has caused major issues, such as the rise of the opioid market and the smuggling of heavy weaponry into Poland. It will take titanic effort from the SB to crack down on this black market and an even larger effort from the government to handle the economic issue that has caused this black market issue."
