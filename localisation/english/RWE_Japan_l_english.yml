The party pits Japan against the global order that was established with the fall of the USA and sees Japan as the logical successor of the USA as democratic world leader.

  RWE_JAP_Sick_Democracy:0 "Ghosts of '55"
  RWE_JAP_Sick_Democracy_desc:0 "Since the end of the American occupation of Japan, one party has consistently dominated the National Diet and Japanese politics with it: the Liberal Democratic Party. Popular among many layers of Japanese society, ranging from farmers to the housewives, the LDP maintained a one-party dominance over Japan untill the 1980s, when the 1955 system of political parties failed to properly respond to the ever-changing world and the LDP started to crumble. The fall of the United States could not have come at a worse time for the LDP. Following the 1978 leadership election that pitted Tanaka against Fukuda and Ohira and the phyrric victory of the 1979 election, the LDP was on the brink of self-destruction. \n\nFollowing the Lockheed investigation that would lead to the arrest of Tanaka in 1976, the six young LDP members defected and formed the New Liberal Club in protest against the corruption of the party. Being able to muster 6% of the vote in the '76 election, the NLC nestled it in the middle of Japanese politics and led to the LDP losing its majority, though continueing to govern without a coalition untill the early '80s. From there, the New Liberal Club would slowly rebrand itself as a viable centrist option against the LDP, but a sensible option compared to the socialist or communist party. The fracturing of the Japanese political landscape also benefitted the JSP and JCP, as those dissatisfied with the status quo also flocked to them. In the aftermath of the 1983 election, the '55 system of politics had been buried by the succes of the Clean Government Party and the New Liberal Club, kickstarting the new era of Japanese coalition politics, mirroring much of the democratic realities of pre-communist Western Europe. \n\nSince then, the LDP has slowly started to retreat into its conservative shell. It has been dragged, kicking and screaming, into an uncomfortable political position, having to make deals to simply survive as a government. Compromise isn't something new for it, as the old factionalist system of the LDP has brought experience with it, but the threat of the NLC and Clean Government has slowly cut away from the liberal corners of the LDP. Now, with a surprise showing in 2008 election, the party governs under Tamogami, a uncompromising nationalist that could not have governed in the '55 system, but now has free reign. It will take time for the LDP to show if it can survive in this new climate, or if it has to adapt to a point of no return."

  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_desc:0 "When the United States of America fell, the people of Japan could feel it: not in their hearts, but in their wallets. As the United States crumbled, so did the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The price we had to pay for the failures of the liberal world order were simply too high for the country to bear and, as the LDP grappled with combatting the issues brought on by an era of economic stagnation, the opposition profited from the salarymen that lost their jobs, the housewives that lost their husbands or the students that lost their future. \n\nSince the fall of the US, the Japanese economy has grown only 1% in terms of GDP annually, while real wages have fallen around 5% compared to their '80s counterparts. Price levels have stagnated and economic inequality has grown. To combat the crisis, Japan has put on a staggering amount of debt, yet the Lost Decades march on. As 2010 rolls around, Japan still sits in this shallow pool of economic stagnation and no real perspective for the future. We can only watch as our rivals in East Asia, such as Korea, China, Vietnam and India all experience economic growth we can now only dream off. An enormous effort will need to be made if we are ever to pick up Japan from this lake of financial regret."
  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_NLC_1:0 "The Remedy for Liberalism"
  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_NLC_1_desc:0 "The Lost Decades show precisely what happens when too much government intervention goes unchecked, turning the state into a corporation able to properly help the people, but unable to keep the economy healthy. The liberalism of the 21st century thought embraced by the NLC seeks to embrace a new school of liberalist thinking that rejects the neoliberal and classical liberal notions of no state intervention. Instead, the new wave of liberalism in Japan embraces a semi-Keynesian approach to government, while still stressing the importance of a healthy government budget. The government will pull the economy out of the slump it is in, but as efficiently as possible. Unlike the social democrats, new liberalism does not just throw money at people and expect them to do the rest, but effectively boost the economy with stimulants in the form of cash injections, government projects and deregulating the economy, especially its protectionist tendencies. For if the market is free if the economy is not chained in excessive and fundamentally wrong rules."
  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_NLC_2:0 "Cured Liberalism"
  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_NLC_2_desc:0 "The situation that was once left behind by the overtly neoliberal LDP has been cleaned up by the NLC. While much work had to be done, even at unforeseen expenses, the NLC has been able to free the market and keep it clean, effectively boosting the economy without delving into the depravity of neoliberalism like the LDP before it did. Corruption is being tackled, big corporations are challenged by the smaller businesses and the urban economies of Tokyo, Hiroshima and Sapporo are booming. Inequality has risen under the NLC government, but that's perhaps the cost we should be willing to pay if it means pulling the economy out of the slump it has been in. With the reconstruction process in full swing, it will take some time to completely heal from the Lost Decades, §Gbut eventually, Japan will be cured§!."

  rw_jap.1.t:0 "Status of the Shinri Party"
  rw_jap.1.d:0 "A recent report from PSIA has raised some eyebrows in the administration and Tamogami's decision is needed after another recent public protest against the subject of the report: Shoko Asahara and his Shinri Party. \n\nA party founded by cult leader Shoko Asahara and closely connected to his cult known as \"Aum Shinrikyo\", the organisation has been under the watchful eye of the PSIA since its foundation. While an official religious organization since 1989, Aum has become the subject of public debate after several incidents across Japan that seemingly were tied to the party. The most recent one was the failed sarin attack in 1995, but inconclusive evidence at the time led to Asahara nor his organisations found guilty of the charges of domestic terrorism. Since then, the cult has only grown among college educated folk and has gained a political following. Preaching about the end of times and the coming nuclear armageddon, the Shinri Party and Aum remain public threats in the eyes of the Japanese government. \n\nYet, with public protests against the party growing and the recent reports indicating possible Soviet connections, perhaps it would be wise to expand the PSIA's ability to monitor the party and its members, even if such an action could conflict with the constitution."
  rw_jap.1.a:0 "Perhaps more monitoring is wise"
  rw_jap.1.b:0 "They're dangerous, but authoritarianism is even more dangerous"
  rw_jap.2.t:0 "The Pillars we Stand On"
  rw_jap.2.d:0 "With the current situation in the National Diet, the LDP does not hold a majority of the seats and is thus forced to form a coalition government. Having formed a government in late 2008 with the New Liberal Club and the Clean Government Party, this coalition of the right was not expected to last as long as it has. Yet, despite its longevity, the coalition remains shaky. At any moment, the JCP can hit the government with a dreaded vote of no confidence and one of the coalition parties, sensing blood in the water, may strike the LDP. Thus, the coalition we now have is one simply build on fear: the LDP fears its partners betraying it and its partners fear a betrayal costing one of them a victory in a following snap election. It remains to be seen if fear is as strong of a material as trust when building a coalition."
  rw_jap.2.a:0 "I don't trust you, but you're my only option"
  rw_jap.3.t:0 "State Visit to Taiwan"
  rw_jap.3.d:0 "Despite the bad relationship between Taiwan and Japan, the recent situation in mainland Asia has forced a friendly gesture from Taipei. Seeking to find more allies for recognition and as military partners, Taiwan has invited the Japanese prime minister to come to Taipei on a state visit. Japan, aware of the historical baggage it carries, especially with a natiionalist LDP in the government, still seeks to counter the growing influence of maoist China and has thus accepted this proposed visit to Taiwan. \n\nOnce there, the visit was grand. Chiang Hsiao-Yen, Taiwan's little despot, showed Tamogami around the slightly depressing capital of Taipei, while Taiwanese armed forces stood by, protecting the entire ceremony. At the end of it, Tamogami was invited to hold a speech in the president's palace on the future of Taiwanese-Japanese relations, an offer he reluctantly accepted. Tamogami knows the situation all to well and is smart enough to realize that the Taiwanese government is poking Japan for an apology for Japanese crimes during the Second World War, such as the use of comfort women in Taiwan. Yet, Tamogami himself has been a staunch anti-apologist for decades at this point and conceding to what Taiwan wants would hurt his image back home. The question is now: will Tamogami apologize for the war crimes the Japanese Empire committed during the Second World War or will he simply ignore the Taiwanese pressure?"
  rw_jap.3.a:0 "We have to answer for the crimes of the past"
  rw_jap.3.b:0 "...Yet who said those crimes had ever even happened?"
  rw_jap.4.t:0 "Does the Victor write History?"
  rw_jap.4.d:0 "A recent action from the Tokyo city council has drawn backlash from various nationalist organisations across Japan, while also drawing praise from the New Liberal Club, the JCP and JSP. While expanding the Tokyo education policy, the local government decided against the use of the national-mandated history books in the Tokyo metropolitan area and, instead, opted for a new version of the books written by members of the University of Tokyo. This has caused major scandal due to the revisions inside the new history books, which acknowledge the \"war crimes\" supposedly committed by imperial Japan, the hypocrisy of the anti-imperialist message of the Japanese Empire and the horror of the second Sinno-Japanese war. \n\nThis decision has led to the government having to take a stance to calm the situation down. While nationalists, especially from Nippon Kaigi, want the government to revert the decision made by the local government, many other organisations and even our coalition partner the NLC have made it very clear that such a government action would not be tolerated. With a decision needed, Tamogami has to decide."
  rw_jap.4.a:0 "We cannot ignore history"
  rw_jap.4.b:0 "Soviet propaganda is not what teachers need!"
  rw_jap.5.t:0 "Senkaku Island Clashes"
  rw_jap.5.d:0 "Reports from the JNDF on the Senkaku Islands have informed us of a recent pattern: Chinese ships loyal to Beying have started to patrol near the waters of the island chain, potentially seeking to scare the Japanese forces there and reinforce their claims. \n\nThis kind of international posturing is something Japan simply can not tolerate. Isolated as Japan currently is, China is just as isolated from most of the international stage, with an economy that can't compete with the Japanese after the failures of their maoist policies. Yet their army and navy are still big and, if we would threaten this patrol near the Senkaku Islands, war may very well be on the horizon sooner than later."
  rw_jap.5.a:0 "Reinforce the garrison and send a patrol"
  rw_jap.5.b:0 "We cannot risk war, ignore the patrol"
  rw_jap.6.t:0 "65th Anniversary of the Nagasaki bombing"
  rw_jap.6.d:0 "A moment of silence was felt across Japan today, as prime minister Tamogami visited Nagasaki to remember the atomic bombing of the city in 1945, marking the end of the Second World War and the start of American occupation. An aura of humility was felt even by the ever-tough prime minister of Japan, who did not wear his military and disciplined personality today. Instead, the prime minister looked somber and grim, even during the speech he gave. In it, he told how he felt true devestation on this day, feeling the destruction a nuclear weapon has brought to Japan and the many families that lost a loved one due to the bomb. A photo of the prime minister surpressing a tear during the speech has already been spread across the nation via the news, though critics aren't as moved by the speech of the prime minister. Many consider his speech even rather distasteful, as the prime minister still seeks to kickstart a Japanese nuclear program. According to them, it seems as if the president isn't so much moved by the destruction of the atomic bomb, as fascinated by its potential destruction, nor is he crying due to the loss of lives, but due to the loss of Japanese lives."
  rw_jap.6.a:0 "We can only hope it never happens again..."
  rw_jap.7.t:0 "An Unfortunate Chain of Events"
  rw_jap.7.d:0 "Few people could have predicted the event that would hit Japan today, nor the implications of such an event hitting Japan. Yet, even in a society where every little detail is planned, from the buttons on one's shirt to the humidity of the air, some things just can not be planned. Like an earthquake that causes a tsunami that causes the worst nuclear meltdown in the history of man. \n\nIt happened far too quick to respond. A 9.1-magnitude undersea megathrust earthquake hit the shore of Sendai on March the 11th. Despite it being one of the strongest earthquakes in recorded Japanese history, it wasn't the earthquake that would cause deaths and damage, but the major tsunami that followed. 10.000 lives were lost and entire towns wiped from the map by the wave. Yet the worst had yet to come. \n\nThe wave that had hit Sendai would damage the diesel backup power systems of the nuclear power stations of Fukushima Daiichi, Fukushima Daini, Tokai and Onagawa causing several explosions right after the wave had hit. If the destruction of the earthquake and tsunami of both historic proportions wasn't enough, than the problems of four nuclear power plants exploding and the radioactive cloud of the fires would be. \n\nAlready, a state of emergency has been declared across much of the Japanese east coast. Experts all agree that this was the \"perfect storm\": a force majeure that simply could not have been stopped even if we knew in advance. Yet the same reports have made abundantly clear that the power plants that did explode that day could have definetely modernized, with many technical errors having piled up during that faithful day to lead to the eventual, radioactive conclusion."
  rw_jap.7.a:0 "Japan simply can't catch a break, can it?"
  rw_jap.8.t:0 "Tokyo Tap Water Contamination"
  rw_jap.8.d:0 "As the situation around the nuclear power plants is starting to get contained by TEPCO and government efforts, nuclear contaimination from the water leaking out of the power plants in Sendai has started to become another worry for the Japanese government. Already, an exclusion zone around the Sendai coast has been made, keeping fishermen and civilians out of the irradiated waters. Yet, our efforts can only go so far and already, tap water across the Sendai coast has become contaminated by the radiation of the nuclear power plants. In Tokyo, the local government has stepped in with fresh bottles of water to keep the citizens safe from the irradiated tap water, costing Tokyo millions in yens on the already high humanitarian costs post-Tohoku earthquake. With more citizens displaced after the nuclear accident coming to Tokyo, the local government has urged both the national government and local communities to help with this monumental effort."
  rw_jap.8.a:0 "Don't drink the tap water!"
  rw_jap.9.t:0 "Blue Jumpsuits and Government Distrust"
  rw_jap.9.d:0 "With the clean up of the affected region on its way, a recent set of photos has sparked public mockery against the LDP. Politicians and government officials were photographed helping with the clean up, something that would soon become the target of public criticism and mockery for not only the slow government response to the Tohoku disaster, but also for the actual lack of help from these particular officials during the clean up. Many have seen it as a distasteful PR stunt, with politicians trying to gain public favour by showing how \"much they have helped\" with the clean up. \n\nAlready, media outlets have reported on the extreme criticism from both the public and experts the government has received for this PR stunt and it clearly shows in the polls, as the LDP is continueing to lose support to the opposition and its coalition partners."
  rw_jap.9.a:0 "Perhaps that was a bit out of touch?"
  rw_jap.10.t:0 "Opposition criticizes Slow Response"
  rw_jap.10.d:0 "\"It has been a month since the Tohoku disaster, yet the government seems far too busy with its own factionalism and red tape that it has completely forgotten to properly respond to the situation in Sendai. People are dying or missing and yet, our government does not have the political will to act and help. The opposition is dissapointed with this lack of initiative and effort from the government and the opposition is clearly not the only one, as local governments and the public seem to feel the same way. We thus advise the government to take a more direct approach to the current situation in Sendai and the clean up effort by establishing an agency for this specific disaster. The scale of the situation demands an onorthodox and, yes, perhaps offensive approach, because we simply do not have the time to play politics during these times\". \n\nThe criticism of the JCP's chairman could have been the knive to slice through the tense atmosphere in the Diet, for the opposition parties were running out of patience with the government's lack of response. Even the New Liberal Club and Clean Government Party did not share the LDP's careful optimism of the current government effort, with both refusing to respond during this session. Their silence cements the bad position the LDP has found itself in. A rapid response is needed."
  rw_jap.10.a:0 "Perhaps our government is running out of time..."
  rw_jap.11.t:0 "Sayonara, Nuclear Power!"
  rw_jap.11.d:0 "A few months have passed since the disaster in Sendai and the slow leaking of information has continued to feed a increasingly frustated public. This week, thousands of Japanese workers, students and housewives gathered in Tokyo to march against nuclear power and the nuclear program envisioned by PM Tamogami. While mainly opposing nuclear power and the nuclear program, the protests have demanded the nationalist prime minister to step down for his slow reaction to the Tohoku disaster and his continued support for Japan's nuclear energy policy. \n\nThe news of the protests has reached the international media and many speculate that the nuclear future Japan once envisioned is now destined for the dustbins of history. The opposition in the diet, such as the JSP and JCP, have been vocally supportive of the protests, though have yet to act on the demand to remove Tamogami as prime minister, either due to the fear of being accused of political opportunism or because they simply do not know if either the NLC or the Clean Government Party would support a potential vote of no confidence against Tamogami's government. Whatever the case may be, the end of the Tamogami government seems to come closer."

  rw_jap.12.d:0 "In a rather emotional public broadcast to the nation, prime minister Toshio Tamogami has revealed his intent to resign as prime minister, believing that he is simply not up to the job to guide the divided nation through the Tohoku disaster effectively. Chained by bureaucracy, factionalism, the National Diet and his own beliefs, Tamogami has stated that someone \"far more capable in the arena of politics and humanitarian relief\" will have to take his position as prime minister, for he can simply not face the crisis Japan is experiencing. \n\nWhile his letter of resignation will still need to be delivered to the Diet, Tamogami's resignation has become the symbolic end of an era for many Japanese people. While it has softened the fall of the LDP in the polls, for many voters do see his resignation as the honourable thing to do, the LDP has fallen so far behind that it realistically cannot catch up any more before 2012. With the end of the Tamogami government comes perhaps also the end of the LDP's story in Japanese politics."

  rw_jap.13.d:0 "It has been months since the resignation of Tamogami and still, the LDP has yet to appoint a new leader. Several members of the party and government have already come forward, vying for the position of the LDP's leadership. Among these men, three currently stand out. \n\nShigeru Ishiba is the most peculiar politician of the LDP and an important member of the old Tanaka faction. While much of the liberal establishment of the faction has since then defected to the New Liberal Club, Ishiba himself rebranded to fit more in the right-wing LDP. Considered a military geek or \"otaku\" by his peers, Ishiba has been a strong advocate for a Japanese nuclear arsenal and the expansion of the National Defense Force, even copying the old US marines and establishing a specialized Japanese Defensive Marine Force with the task of keeping the islands of Japan safe. While a peculiar man, Ishiba does not enjoy the same popularity among the party as his peers in this race do. \n\nThe second man in the race is Nobuo Kishi, member of the Seiwa Council faction of the LDP and, just like his brother Shinzo Abe, a vehement Japanese nationalist affiliated with Nippon Kaigi. Having served in previous governments, Kishi has the experience needed to be the next LDP leader, yet his views on nuclear weapons and energy and his conservative opinion on the monarchy may hold him back during this election. \n\nThe last man for the job is also the least orthodox of the bunch. Ryuho Okawa, leader of the Happy Science faction of the LDP and the head of the Happy Science religious organization, is for many in the LDP the most dangerous pick to potentially win this race. Leader of a cult of spiritualists and claiming to be the reincarnation of a being known as \"El Cantare\" (which he claims is a number of beings combined, including Hermes and Buddha), Okawa is seen as having too much bagage to be a safe pick for the LDP in an election year. While his views on combatting the demographic problems of Japan are viable, his religion may just be too much for many LDP voters."

He cited the lack of government ability to contain the disaster in Sendai, the growing instability of the governing coalition and that, in his opinion, the LDP was not long for this world: \n\n\"The Liberal Democrats have lost a piece of their soul with the resignation of Tamogami and are far too busy soul searching for any governing party to allow. As long as the LDP does not know what kind of party it wants to be, the opposition has to save Japan from chaotic government bureaucracy and motion that it has no confidence in the ruling cabinet.

Among those honoured by the shrine are class A war criminals from the Japanese war in the Pacific during the Second World War, which is the root of most controversies surrounding the shrine. Generally, people do not expect politicians, especially cabinet members, to visit the shrine, as that reflects poorly on Japan's international image. Yet Tamogami, the staunch nationalist and historical revisionist that he is, does not share that concern with most. \n\nThe visit of the PM to the Yasukuni shrine has caused public and international outrage. China, Korea and the ROC all demand an apology from Tamogami, as these countries see the shrine as glorification of Japan's imperial past and the warcrimes committed during it in the name of Japanese imperialism. The opposition has demanded something similair, noting that the visit to the Yasukuni shrine is in poor taste for the PM to do and has tarnished the international image of Japan during a time that closer cooperation is needed. \n\nYet, while they all seek an apology, many LDP voters back Tamogami's visit to the shrine. Not apologizing may be a grand PR stunt for the LDP and would be welcomed by its nationalist electorate."

Most recently, the debate around the imperial family has surrounded Akihito and the viability of the imperial bloodline with the current succession laws. The main issue remains that women cannot retain their imperial status after marriage, leading to an ever smaller family of imperials to succeed to the throne. The main issue surrounding Akihito is that all of his children are either female or have only female children themselves, leaving the throne in existential danger if no male prince is born or if the government allows women to keep their imperial status after marriage and thus inherit the throne, even if married. \n\nWith us potentially facing the extinction of the imperial family in the future, the conservative LDP has to act quick. While our conservative lawmakers mainly moan about the traditions of the imperial family, even Tamogami can accept the fact that no change means the death of Japan's oldest institution and an unifying symbol for the Japanese people, something he as a nationalist refuses to be destroyed. If that means that women are able to inherit the throne and Japan will be ruled by an empress in the near future, that would be a sacrifice worthy of the throne for Tamogami."

According to the JSP's leader Mizuho Fukushima, the nuclear program paints a back on the Japanese nation. As long as the program is going on, the international community will shun Japan for its attempts to create nuclear weaponry and, if things go too far, the Soviet Union may even opt for intervention. The JCP adds to that that the nuclear program costs millions every year and that such money could be far better spend in the economy and social welfare programs that have been lacking ever since the prime-ministership of Shinzo Abe.

Yet hope remained, for the coalition would still have a majority. \n\nThat moment of hope would be shot down by the New Liberal Club. The MPs of the NLC voted against the government, leading to a slight majority in favour of the vote of no confidence. \n\nIn an adress to the public, the NLC's leader Yukio Edano explained this drastic decision: \"Japan has been put in the worst spot it has seen since 1945. The Tohoku disaster compounds our already waning position internationally and the slow government response does not help wit this issue at all. The NLC, despite its membership in the Tamogami government, was always blocked by the unstable factionalism of the LDP.

While the LDP has plans to publicly celebrate the adoption of this new, fresh bill, we haven't discussed how we should include the effort made by Komeito to allow this bill to pass. Through compromise and some advise, Komeito has been an asset to helping to get the bill through and it would secure our ties with the party in our special relationship if we celebrated their part in the bill too. Yet, others point that this should be a special moment for the LDP alone, as we had promised the bill in our campaign last election."

It may be in our interest to help the party out if we want them to be a serious partner in the next election. However, others seem to think that this is completely Komeito's responsibility and that the party should thus accept the blame it has gotten."

  newsrw.35.d:0 "News from Japan has shocked the world and has forced governments across the globe to swiftly react with precautionary measures, as an anthrax epidemic has hit the heart of Japan, Tokyo. Already, 15.200 cases have been reported across the metropolitan area, with another few thousand expected to follow in the coming week. The city council of Tokyo has already responded with a temporary lockdown of the city and affected areas, with hospitals running overtime to combat the infection. \n\nThe cause of the incident is hotly contested at this point in time, with many suspecting it to be a bioterrorist attack against the Japanese state. However, evidence remains scarce currently, with the priority of the government being the finding, containing and treating of the affected. While anthrax isn't as infective as many other infections, people are still advised to not share a space with infected patients."

  newsrw.36.d:0 "East Asia has been filled with geopolitical tension since the dissolution of the United States of America. Washington's fall left a void in much of the Pacific, one that wasn't simple to quickly fill by any single nation. However, recent development in Japan seems to indicate a return to geopolitical balance in the region. \n\nJapan has always opposed the Chinese People's Republic and its ambitions in Asia. The maoists of Beying have been aggressive and assertive in their foreign policy, often at the expense of other nations. Combine that with the post-USA domino effect that dominated the Pacific and you have a recipe for conflict between Japan's liberal democracy and the communist order. Yet Japan isn't alone in this clash and the treaty of Kaghoshima signed today proves this. Together with other nations across Asia, Japan has formalized a military alliance known as the \"Kaghoshima Accord\" with the expressed goal of containing Chinese revolutionary chauvinism while preserving the current status quo in East Asia. Beying has already criticized the treaty heavily for its anti-Chinese intention and considers it a potential threat to its own sovereignty."

The aggressive ambitions of the Chinese Communist Party has often led to a further distance between it and the Vietnamese Communist Party, to the point that the VCP has cut almost all ties with the People's Republic of China, even going so far in recognizing Taiwan. Yet, with war between Japan and the PRC having started, Vietnam has taken the decision to secure the future of the Indochinese revolution once and for all. Joining forces with the Japanese and Taiwan, Vietnam has become a full member of the Kaghoshima Accord and has mobilized its troops to help in the conflict."

  newsrw.38.d:0 "With the People's Republic of China backed into a corner by the Kaghoshima Accord, it finally seems that the Russian bear has taken notice of the quickly changing situation in the Far East. As anti-Chinese forces now occupy the capital of the old communist regime, the Soviet Union has taken action and intervened in the war, occupying parts of Manchuria and Xinjiang and establishing several buffer states between the new, Kaghoshima-backed government of China and itself. \n\nWith a Soviet Republic in both Manchuria and Xinjiang, the Soviet Union has seemingly left the PRC for the dogs. The relationship between the Soviet Union and China had been rather bad since the 70s and the collapse of the United States cemented the Sinno-Soviet split: with no capitalist nation to truly consider a threat, the only real threat remained to Soviet global power remained the Chinese, even despite their bad economic practices. Yet, whatever the case may be for Soviet intervention, one thing is rather clear: Chinese communism is on the brink of collapse."

  newsrw.45.d:0 "With the faith in democracy fading across Asia in the 20th century, Japan proves to not be an exception to this pattern of democratic backsliding. Yet, where other nations fell into communist dictatorships, Japan would slide down the opposite direction. Under the direction of the LDP's most radical faction and its benefactor, Nippon Kaigi, the Japanese government has suspended the National Diet and restored the Imperial Household to its pre-1945 status as the sole rulers of Japan. \n\nWhat one may forget behind the spectacle of the restoration event prepared by the Japanese government is the reality of the situation: namely, that this monarchist restoration is only a restoration in name of the monarchy's power. De facto, a very radical group of Japanese politicians and military members affiliated with Nippon Kaigi and the Uyoku Dantai rule behind the curtains. While the owner of the Chrysanthemum throne smiles and waves to the Japanese public, it is this shadow cabal that now leads Japan to a extremely hostile foreign policy."

With the JCP now in power, Japan may very well enter an unique phase in its history, replacing the old right-wing establishment with a party explicitly rejecting this past establishment. \n\nWith the JCP now in power, Japan seeks to improve its ties to the rest of the communist world. However, the JCP will most likely seek to tie itself with the Warsaw Pact and Russia instead of the People's Republic of China, having been vocally critical of the maoist government of Beijing and its imperialist ambitions in recent decades. Beyond foreign policy, the JCP has also vowed to reform Japan's energy sector to become a totally independent and sustainable sector and to hold a democratic referendum on the fate of the Japanese monarchy in this new, modern Japan."

While the NLC has had a rocky and stagnant time since the 2000s, it seems that the failure of the LDP in the 2011 Tohoku disaster shoved a large part of the old LDP electorate into the arms of the NLC's charming leader, Yukio Edano. \n\nA man that has been able to properly mobilize the young voters of Japan, Edano has always been a household name in Japanese politics. With his leadership of the NLC, the party has embraced the original message of the NLC: a party for the reasonable, moderate Japanese person. Talks about a potential expansion of the party to include the smaller munincipal liberal parties has allegedly been going on under Edano, with the goal being the formation of a true, centre-liberal party to dominate Japanese politics for the next decade to come."

  newsrw.48.d:0 "Out of the three possible victors of the Japanese election, the JSP was definetely one of the least orthodox picks. A big tent of progressive social democrats and reformist marxists, the party wedged itself into the ideological niche between the NLC and JCP during the construction of the post-'55 system of Japanese politics. Since then, the party has had a tough time standing out. With the left-wing vote often going to the JCP and the more moderate vote going to the NLC, the JSP has had to fight to continue existing. \n\nYet, it seems that during this election, the JSP was truly able to break out of its niche. Establishing itself as the logical left-wing party, it sapped the JCP of much of its more moderate electorate, while stealing the NLC's progressive vote entirely with the JSP's progressive leader Mizuho Fukushima. With the JSP now in power, Japan is looking towards a reconstruction of both Japanese government and society. Fiercly anti-nuclear, in favour of same-sex marriage and opposed to neoliberalism and -conservatism, the JSP will bring Japan into a new age of politics."

The party had overseen one of the greatest disasters in recent Japanese memories with a slow and often clunky response. With its neck deep in corruption scandals and few politicians that could fill the shoes of Tamogami, the LDP was not long for the Japanese diet, at least, according to these experts. Yet, like so often, the party has proven them wrong this week, winning the Japanese election with a majority of the votes. \n\nWith Tamogami now gone, the LDP's course is unsure and with it, Japan's course. While the factions inside the party have started to contest eachother in the hopes to select the next party leader, the lack of a leader did not stop the LDP's march to the polls. With figures like Nubuo Kishi and Shiberu Ishiba having wooed the public, it seems likely that they will fill the spot left behind by Tamogami and, possibly, decide the course of the LDP for the next decade, as it continues to struggle for its right to exist in a post-'55 Japanese democracy."

Both agreed that the changing situation has turned drastically in favour of enemies of liberal democracy and that, if the balance in the Pacific should be maintained, that only a joint alliance led by Japan and Canada could do the trick. Thus, the two regional powers agreed to merge the pre-existing Democratic League and East Asian Security Organisation into a single entity, known as the Pacific Ocean Treaty Organisation, or POTO for short.

In recent weeks, the situation near the Senkaku Islands turned the situation hot. With the JNDF fortifying positions around the islands, China accused the Japanese government of violating the territorial sovereignty of the PRC, which, in the eyes of the Beijing government, is grounds for conflict. Japan however refutes this allegation, stating that it has both de facto and de jure control of the Senkaku Island chain and that the Chinese claim to the islands are illegal and illegitimate. \n\nWith the situation now having escelated, Chinese troops with naval and air support have been detected moving towards the island chain while artillery on the mainland is currently harassing the fortifications of the island chain.

When asked about the increasingly tense situation, Japanese prime minister [JAP.GetLeader] ensured the press that the integrity of Japan would not be allowed to be violated. \n\nSoon after the public announcement of the Japanese PM, bombing raids targetting Chinese ships near the island chain commenced. While the Chinese government was initially unresponsive to the situation, Tokyo was clearly far less willing to preserve the image of peace in the region. With a clear violation of territorial integrity and thus a breach of the international rule of law, at least according to the Japanese, Tokyo has publicly talked about the situation being a war with the Chinese government."

However, few would have dared to think that the Japanese army, one that has been neutered for a very long time by Article 9 of the Japanese constitution, would be able to march to and occupy the capital of the People's Republic. \n\nAlready, news from the old Chinese capital confirm young Chinese men and women fighting in a desperate bid to keep the Japanese out of parts of Beijing. Yet, as the day went on, the noise of gunfire started to silence across the capital of China. In the end, the Japanese forces finally secured the heart of the Chinese revolution."

From there, the People's Liberation Army has gone ahead and seized Tokyo, bringing the war closer to an end. \n\nWith the flag of the PLA and China now waving over the economic hub of East Asia, the Japanese war effort has been severly crippled. With thousands, perhaps even millions of Chinese soldiers marching through the streets of Tokyo, many Japanese people have taken up arms against the occupying force, some of whom are members of the secretive home army of the Japanese NDF.

Reports from the island claim that republican soldiers have surrendered to the encroaching PLA in the capital, but the rest of the forces have moved into the mountains, seeking to prepare an effective guerilla campaign from there against the maoist occupation in the hopes to reclaim the island at a later date.

In one case, an Australian men was executed without a trial after blowing up a PLA logistical truck with a home-made bomb, hurting 5 PLA members in the process.
