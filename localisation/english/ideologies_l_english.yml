Central to the ideology is its adherence to the 'Third Hellenic Civilisation', believing that contemporary Greece is a distinct descendent from the old Byzantine and ancient Greek civilizations. It wants to uphold Greek institutions, like the monarchy, while also focusing on protecting Greece’s national sovereignty and suppressing ‘non-Greek’ movements."
 social_nationalist:0 "Social Nationalism"
 social_nationalist_desc:0 "Social Nationalism is a unique political strain of thought native to Lebanon and the Fertile Crescent. The movement has its roots in early anti-colonial groups, having influenced Syrian and Lebanese politics since the 1950s. It advocates for the unification of the lands that made up the historical Fertile Crescent, secularism, anti-capitalism, and nationalization of key industries."

 kmt_fr:0 "Kuomintang Ultra Rightist"
 kmt_fr_desc:0 "The Kuomintang, or Chinese Nationalist Party, was at one point the sole governing authority over the Chinese state until the defeat of the Nationalist government in the Chinese Civil War. While technically a united, vanguard-esque political faction, the KMT is internally divided into a myriad of sub-groups.\n\nThe Ultra-Right of the Kuomintang were primarily born out of the White Terror immediately following Chiang kai-shek's retreat to Taiwan. This period of martial law saw the large scale imprisonment, torture and execution of political dissidents by the Taiwan government. Greatly expanded during this period, the intelligence and security services of the Taiwan government began to follow their own more extreme dogma of party line. Harsh anti-communism, political repression and a hardline political vanguard distinguish the Ultra-rightist Kuomintang from their less extreme nationalist counterparts."
 white_nationalism:0 "White Nationalism"
 white_nationalism_desc:0 "While not uniquely American, White Nationalism is most commonly associated with the militant elements of the Pre and Post American Ultra Right. White Nationalism is functionally similar to Neo-Nazism, advocating for a united White Nation, or Ethnostate. Concepts like multiculturalism are rejected, often violently, as degredation of the white race.\n\nThe most prominent brand of this ideology was born in the United States under the Ku Klux Klan, a militant white nationalist organization founded to resist Reconstruction. In contemporary times, White Nationalism is most commonly associated with the various disorganized groups of Post-American terrorist groups. Covington's Montana is the most prevalent example of such organizations, although it remains internally challenged by Spencerites and supporters of figures like William Luther Pierce."
 wlp_thought:0 "William Luther Pierce Thought"
 wlp_thought_desc:0 "William Luther Pierce is arguably one of the most influential figures in the American Ultra Right, having been politically active both before and after the Collapse. The institutional chaos of the American Collapse played a critical role in the proliferation and popularity of Pierce's ideas in the Right, as many radicals blamed the Union's failure on racial and ideological impurity.\n\nPierce's most seminal work, the Turner Manifesto, would become a major building block in the foundations of Covington's Montana. Described charitably as a masturbatory fantasy, Pierce outlines and speculates on the benefits of what he described as a Perpetual Race War, believing that White Americans would never have true freedom without reclaiming their mantle as the superior race.\n\nPierce's assassination in 2001 would cement his martyrdom for the American Right, with his National Alliance Party falling under the sway of radicals not long after. In the contemporary world, Pierce's ideas have evolved into the New National Alliance in Montana, less of a political group and more of a glorified terrorist cell, whose goals have become even more disconnected from reality than their late ideologue's. Under this new party, the enemies of the White Nation among us will be purged, and a new age of purity brought about."

While technically a united, vanguard-esque political faction, the KMT is internally divided into a myriad of sub-groups.\n\nThe Chiangist faction is largely an offshoot of the ultra-rightists, arguing against their more extreme tendencies. As their name implies, the Chiangists lay claim to the political legacy of Chiang kai-shek, the late military dictator of the Republic of China. Straying away from the ultra-right, the Chiangists argue in favor of maintaining the spirit of the party and its' original aims. The Chiangist faction seeks to maintain political tutledge and the importance of guiding the Chinese people towards democracy through a vanguard party. This stance has been regarded as revisionist by the ultra-right, while the left KMT claims it to be whitewashing of Chiang's authoritarian tendencies."

The Taiwan branch of this party represents a strange blend of the political vanguardism of the KMT Right with the social democratic elements of the Left, while simultaneously championing the legacy of Chiang and Sun Yat-sen. This element of the party remains extremely small due to their reconciliatory stance towards the People's Republic, leading to allegations of being a faction of Quislings."
