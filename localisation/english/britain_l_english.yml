###leaderdescs
POLITICS_CHARLES_KENNEDY_DESC:0 "The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom is not the kind of person you’d first expect to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Most people would imagine a refined upperclassman from London or Surrey, and not a jokey Scotsman from the Highlands with a taste for David Bowie and a gin and tonic. But reality has no time for such pretensions, and Charles Peter Kennedy does in fact lead the biggest democracy in Europe.\n\nBorn to a small family, Kennedy was raised Catholic, and joined Labour at the age of fifteen. Entering the prestigious University of Glasgow debating union where many young Scots entered politics, he was quickly drafted into the selection list to challenge a Tory seat in the Scottish Highlands. Overturning a Conservative majority in the election of 1983 at the young age of 23, his amiable personality seemed to be a path to political stardom. Quickly becoming a junior minister in the David Owen government, he learnt his craft as a minister for Scottish affairs, before being promoted to Secretary of State for Scotland in 1991. However, his frontbench role was short-lived, as Owen’s resignation and the collapse of Labour control during the government of John Smith brought the Tories under the new moderate face of Kenneth Clarke into government.\n\nAfter Smith left his role in shame, Kennedy was promoted by the new leader, Jack Straw, to a role as Shadow Home Secretary. The unfortunate nature of Clarke’s second election victory caused a massive uptick in support for Proportional Representation, and Kennedy’s personal belief in the policy caused his popularity to upsurge massively during the leadership contest after Straw’s resignation.\n\nKennedy won the leadership with a strong majority, and he proceeded to win the following general election. Kennedy must hold a bright future ahead of him, as his first term comes to an end."
POLITICS_PETER_MANDELSON_DESC:0 "Strangely enough, people don’t know much about Peter Mandelson. It’s known he crafted the strategies of the later Owen government, it was leaked that he’s gay, but he is nicknamed “The Prince of Darkness” for a reason. But here he is as leader of the Labour Party, which no one would have expected before the chaos of the leadership election. He was elected on the basis of making the Labour Party the party of Gaitskell again, but the question is what he’s going to do?"
POLITICS_ED_BALLS_DESC:0 "No one expected him to win. People called him a boring opportunist, an economist with no personality except a smile for the cameras and the occasional self-deprecating joke. But miraculously, almost accidentally, Ed Balls has climbed to the top.\n\nBorn to a distinguished zoologist, Ed Balls went to Oxford and studied Philosophy, Politics and Economics. Joining the Financial Times as an Economics expert, he was quickly picked up by the Labour shadow cabinet in the late 1990’s as an economic advisor. Balls in his time given responsibility for many of the sharp barbs done against the economic policies of the Clarke government.\n\nThen, something happened. People started to recognise Ed Balls.\n\nBalls started to appear on talk shows and on Radio 4. His personality shined, and he was quickly parachuted into a safe seat in London after the unfortunate and sudden death of the sitting MP, Jeremy Corbyn. He was conveniently promoted to Shadow Chancellor in a cabinet reshuffle, with many seeing it as a blatantly opportunistic move on the behalf of Charles Kennedy.\n\nIn dialogues with the Shadow Home Secretary, Balls struck a deal for him to run in the leadership election after Kennedy’s resignation. Very few people expected him to win, but he pulled it off anyway. And now, he leads the country and the party to a new role in politics."
POLITICS_KEN_LIVINGSTONE_DESC:1 "The interesting thing about Ken Livingstone is... well, ask different people and you’ll get different answers. Get a Major staffer from London and they’ll smirk about how despite his “machine”, his days are over in London, get a grassroots Labour member from Liverpool and they’ll talk delightfully about his obsession with newts, get a tired old Union man from Coventry and they’d mumble aggressively about how popular he is with the grassroots themselves.\n\nBorn in Lambeth, he worked as a Cancer technician while his political career started to get off the ground. Entering the Greater London Council, he tried multiple failed parliamentary bids before successfully challenging the leader of the Labour group in the Council, and winning a shock election victory over Cutler’s tory group.\n\nAs leader of the GLC, he pursued socialist policies that made him beloved to the less well-off in the city but hated among the Tories in the City and Kensington. Jumping ship to parliament for his economic minister John McDonnell, he ascended to parliament from the local level. With his experience in local government, he quickly ascended to the de facto leadership of the scattered and confused Labour Left group.\n\nNow, with the Owenites lost and broken, he has complete control of the country. Can the Livingstone Machine rule Britain? Or will he be conquered in the claws of the Conservatives?"
POLITICS_DAVID_CAMERON_DESC:1 "“Typical, bloody typical, you know that? We win the election, and our leader loses his seat. That’s completely unprecedented! I was never Oliver’s best friend, but he was who they voted for!”\n- David Cameron"
POLITICS_NIGE_DESC:1 "Nigel Farage is perhaps one of the most eclectic and prominent politicians of recent years. Some political observers would have said that it was almost inevitable he would become Prime Minister, while some called him a flash in the pan, soon to be overrun by other right-wing demagogues within the Tories and elsewhere. So what is it that makes Farage so special?\n\nIt clearly isn’t his upbringing. Farage was born to a City of London economist who was rumoured to be a notorious drunk. Going to a prestigious school in South London, his first taste of his future career was a speech given in front of the class by Former Prime Minister Keith Joseph, who espoused free market politics. It isn’t his early career either, a hodgepodge of working for capital firms and steelworks companies in the City.\n\nWhat makes Nigel Farage special is his seemingly infinite ambition. Joining the Conservatives in his twenties, he was appointed as an advisor to the Shadow Secretary of State for Defence, Margaret Thatcher. The “Old Woman of the Conservatives” could be called his second big influence after Joseph, and he was quickly shipped off the parliament to become her Parliamentary Private Secretary.\n\nAfter Thatcher stepped down due to old age, Farage became something of a firebrand during the Clarke government, shouting down moderate policies on trade with the Soviets and of course their advocacy for a mixed economy. Farage was assigned to Defence by Letwin, and he became very sharp in parliamentary debates about the topic.\n\nNow, Farage is Prime Minister, having moved mountains to get to this place.\n\nAnd nothing is going to stop him."
POLITICS_RUTH_DAVIDSON_DESC:1 "The first female Prime Minister. The first lesbian Prime Minister. The first Prime Minister who became such within two years of becoming an MP. The first Scottish Tory PM since the 20’s. The woman who needs to prove herself to a country that might not respect her sexuality, her nationality, or her ideology. That woman is Ruth Davidson.\n\nBorn in Edinburgh but raised in the town of Selkirk in the borders, she graduated with a Bachelor in Arts from the University of Edinburgh. Davidson entered BBC Scotland after a radio career, where she became a prominent journalist. After this career, she was inspired to enter politics by Kenneth Clarke. An aide to the Scottish Conservative group asked her to run for a major by-election in Edinburgh in 2009, which she accepted.\n\nThe sitting Liberal MP was resigning their seat as a protest against the Labour government’s investigation into a nuclear arms defence system. Ruth managed to beat the incumbent on the basis of sensible liberal conservatism. The shock victory generated a lot of attention towards Ruth, and her homosexuality and social progressivism made her beloved in her home constituency.\n\nNow, she leads the country, with the ideals of the past, as well as the values of the future."
POLITICS_PETER_MANDELSON_DESC_2:1 "No one knew. That was the point. No one knew the secrets, no one could see past the lies, no one could see the plan. And day after day after day he pushed through it, manipulating, just so he could dismantle the system he learnt to hate. The Prince of Darkness is here, here to make all the reactionary bastards shake in their boots, with a new Labour, a new Britain. A new beginning.\n\nPeter Mandelson was born in Hendon, to the daughter of Herbert Morrison and the advertising manager of the Jewish Chronicle. In his teenage years, he was a member of the Young Communist League, but left, disillusioned. He became leader of the British Youth Council, and travelled to Havana in 1978 for the World Festival of Youth and Students. There, he was met by a number of Soviet men, and they had a long chat.\n\nThey talked about communism, and capitalism, of fat cats and the system that crushes British people into the ground. In the end, Mandelson was forced to admit he was wrong to turn away from communism. He was then asked a simple question.\n\n"Comrade Mandelson, how would you like to make the world a better place?"\n\nHis cover began at the Festival, when he helped "frustrate" a treaty on the nature of youth in capitalist nations. He then climbed the ladder. Director of Communications, MP for some boring town in the North-East, Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. All the while laying the groundwork for frustration in the capitalist system, in the Labour Party, even laying down infiltration into the British military.\n\nHe set up Balls. He knew he would fail. And here he stands on top of the world. What next?"

ENG.1.t:1 "The New Year"
ENG.1.d:1 "As the nation recovers from another healthy Christmas, Charles Kennedy and his cabinet held a press conference this morning about plans for the future, focusing on foreign diplomacy and what Labour was once again elected on, Electoral Reform. After losing the election to Kenneth Clarke in a shock defeat but winning the popular vote in 2002, Kennedy embraced electoral reform, although his cabinet have never appeared to be too happy about it.\n\nKennedy is also expected to pursue matters of party policy, getting his party on side for the parliamentary vote later this year. While not expecting to pull in backbenchers who fear losing their seat, there is significant bipartisan support among the Conservatives and especially the Liberals to pull it in Kennedy's favour."
ENG.1.o1:1 "Interesting."
ENG.2.t:1 "Foreign Secretary Holds A Do With The Communists"
ENG.2.d:1 "In what has been criticised in both nations as presumably a bad move, Foreign Secretary Alan Johnson has hosted a party with the Soviets in London. Johnson has often been criticised for being too light on the Communists, and this hasn't helped his case to some, with others hailing it as an important step for continuing trade neutrality, and others in fringe leftist publications calling it an important milestone in steps towards revolution, although to many that's simply ludicrous. What happens from now remains to be seen, but Johnson appears to be stuck in his role for now."
ENG.2.o1:1 "Seems like a rather fun thing, this Communist party."
ENG.3.t:1 "Balls Goes North"
ENG.3.d:1 "Ed Balls, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, has travelled to Sheffield today to open a new steel factory. While some claim that steel is a failed industry, Balls remains confident in his concepts of economics, and that there is a future to believe in for Northern British Industry. In his speech he detailed his plans for the future, cracking several jokes about his name and at the expense of the Conservatives.\n\nHowever, the intervention of a heckling socialist caught his ire, and he briefly lost control of his temper, shouting at the man to "just shut up". Balls apologised to the man after the speech, and he travelled to his constituency in Liverpool to hold a rare surgery with his constituents."
ENG.3.o1:1 "Balls to them."
ENG.4.t:1 "Kennedy Meets With Leftists"
ENG.4.d:1 "Prime Minister Kennedy has today been reported to have been visited by MP for Brent Central Ken Livingstone in a conversation about how the future of the party will be treated. Kennedy has been criticised for being very lax on private industry, and "handing the control of the country to the City of London" as Livingstone said himself. The meeting has been reported to have been extremely rocky, descending into a shouting match between Kennedy and Livingstone. The Prime Minister has denied the accusations, while Livingstone has stated that the leaks are true, and that "the Left's day will come"."

ENG.6.t:1 "Charles Kennedy: Alcoholic?"
ENG.6.d:1 "BOOZEHOUND KENNEDY? shouted the tabloids this morning after a confusing series of events where Kennedy cut off a visit to Newcastle-Upon-Tyne for confused and unexplained reasons. When reached for comment, Kennedy explained it was because his son was sick and he wanted to check on him. However, some believe it's because of the popular rumour that Kennedy is a practicing alcoholic. The memories of Prime Minister George Brown and his shock resignation due to drinking refreshed in the minds of the populous, many wonder whether Kennedy truly is as lucid as he says he is./n/nThis of course, remains to be seen, but the disappointed crowd in Newcastle didn't get to see the Prime Minister, that's for sure."
ENG.6.o1:1 "I hope he's not a drinker, this is very concerning."
ENG.7.t:1 "The Ulster Issue"
ENG.7.d:1 "Today, Foreign Secretary Alan Johnson travelled to Dublin to meet with Irish diplomats in the case of establishing a trade deal. This is the fourth year in a row that this has been pursued, and it was of course rejected on the basis of British "failure" in the North. Stormont, which was reestablished after abolishment by the Owen government, still remains an extremely rocky governing system, with the "power sharing" being in essence a very weak dictatorship underneath the British eye.\n\nThe unfortunate thing is that Ulster, while quiet now, remains a deeply divided place, where the lowest yearly death toll is 20."
ENG.7.o1:1 "A truly harrowing situation."
ENG.8.t:1 "Kennedy Collapses On Stage"
ENG.8.d:1 "Breaking News: Charles Kennedy has collapsed on stage at a press conference detailing his plans for Proportional Representation...\n\nThe collapse is apparently due to heavy drinking and an unfortunate liver condition...\n\nHe will give a speech in three days, with many expecting him to resign..."
ENG.8.o1:1 "Oh, heavens!"
ENG.9.d:1 "Charles Kennedy has announced his resignation as Prime Minister today in his constituency in the Scottish Highlands. He promises to stay in parliament, and to "keep the clan together". A leadership election within the Labour Party will occur this year, with many expecting Home Secretary Harriet Harman, Foreign Secretary Alan Johnson or Chancellor Ed Balls to take up the torch of the right, taking on Socialist Ken Livingstone. The future remains uncertain."

ENG_Major_Desc:1 "§YJohn Major§!\n--------------\n§LIf you saw and talked to John Major on the street, as you might in one of his trips to meet the city’s residents, you would probably think he’s just a nice old man with strong conservative views. But to the Conservative Party, John Major is a trailblazer. The man who took down the strongest Socialist controlled council in the country, and broke the back of the Livingstone machine. But Major’s story is surprisingly interesting for a man most consider quaint and slightly boring.\n\nJohn Major’s father was a showman in music halls, and worked in circuses in his youth, leading some to joke that Major “ran away from the circus to become an accountant”. Moving to Brixton as a child, Major saw a Commons performance at the age of 13, which he attributed to his political ambition.\n\nBecoming a councillor in Lambeth in the late 60’s, Major moved to the Greater London Council in 1977. During years of Conservative governance of London, Major rose up the ranks rather quickly, despite losing his seat in Streatham in 1985 and moving to a much safer seat in Kensington and Chelsea. As Livingstone established his famous machine, Major was often posed as a possible leader for the council’s Conservative group, but he never opted to stand.\n\nIn the early 2000’s, Major, despite being seen as almost a relic at that point, ran for the leadership and narrowly won against the opposition. The 2005 GLC elections approached, and as Valerie Wise, the diehard socialist leader of the GLC lost steam, Major positioned himself on a platform of moderation and rationality. The historic loss of Labour after a thirty-four year run shocked the nation, and the Conservatives jumped on the opportunity to show Major as the start of a wave of Conservative victories. This did not come to pass.\n\nBut Major is comfortable in his role. It seems, no matter what, that John Major is here to stay.§!"
ENG_Gorbdon_Desc:1 "§YGordon Brown§!\n--------------\n§LGordon Brown is a political soul. He very rarely smiles, his speeches tend to linger for longer than they should, he’s generally considered a very grumpy man. And yet, Brown is widely beloved in Scotland as the third First Secretary at the Old Royal, and national Labour leaders kick themselves nightly that he never became a truly national politician.\n\nBorn in Giffnock but quickly moving to Kirkcaldy, Brown began studying history in the University of Edinburgh at the young age of 16. He was elected Rector of the University while still a student, and became a Journalist after graduating.\n\nAfter a short career at Scottish Television, he entered national parliament in 1983. After a Scottish Parliament was established, he was poked repeatedly by his colleagues to enter it. The intervention of Donald Dewar made him make up his mind, and he became MSP for Kirkcaldy.\n\nAfter Dewar himself stepped down as FS in 1997, Brown’s talent was recognised, and he was made First Secretary of Scotland. While it took a good while for Scotland to like him, Brown soon became an extremely popular figure in Scotland. His influence spread nationally, and now no Labour leader can get anywhere without the help of the “Caledonian Mafia.”\n\nHowever, cracks are beginning to show. Brown is getting old, and his retirement has been rumoured for a long time. The Scottish National Party are gaining popularity in Labour’s strongest bases, and the days of Labour’s iron grip over Scotland could be beginning to wane...§!"

ENG_No_Leader_Desc:1 "§YNo Devolution§!\n--------------\n§LWales is not a place the British government thinks about often. It’s a lynchpin of Labour, home of a couple Tory seats and one or two Liberal seats, and that kind of representation is similar locally. There’s of course the Nationalists, who take two or three seats in Anglesey or Ceredigion, but that’s never really common.\n\nHowever, something is stirring. A kind of chill in the air. Students in Cardiff talk amongst themselves of their deficit of representation. Workers in the Valleys curse Labour’s lack of support. Farmers in Powys grumble about how London decides their fate. The nation is tired. Everyone is tired. And it seems that Plaid Cymru is reaping the rewards.\n\nBut no one notices.\n\nSomething has to give eventually.§!"
ENG_Ian_Paisley_Desc:1 "§YIan Paisley§!\n--------------\n§LBorn in Armagh, Ian Paisley broke off from the Presbyterian Church in Ireland to found a more absurdly radical church in the North known as the Free Presbyterian Church. When the Civil Rights campaign began in Northern Ireland, he established himself as an extremely popular figure among Protestant Unionist communities, asserting himself opposed on principle to them, and on occasion causing multiple riots.\n\nIn the 1970’s during the worst years of the Troubles, Paisley tried to create multiple Unionist militias, but failed to establish them politically. When Prime Minister Callaghan tried to create a Power-Sharing executive in the North, Paisley was the figurehead of a mass strike by major Protestant unions which led to the passing back of power to the Northern Ireland Office. Paisley also established the Democratic Unionist Party, leading it to minor electoral victories.\n\nIn the 80’s, Paisley established himself as a major force of opposition to the peace deal proposed by the Owen government. But it was nonetheless signed. This had a number of electoral effects. For one thing, Paisley’s DUP gained popularity. For another, the similarly named but independent Unionist Democratic Party, widely seen as the political hand of the UVF, gained popularity.In the 1990’s, Paisley entered the parliament at last, and as UUP control crumbled, he gained power over a rapidly declining executive. After the British government under Ken Clarke backed down on their promise to dissolve the executive were an agreement not reached, Paisley made a very clear statement that he was not willing to “hand power to terrorists”.\n\nThe future does not look bright for Northern Ireland. But Paisley remains, the pauper of a dead land.§!"
ENG_Queen_Desc:1 "§YElizabeth II§!\n--------------\n§LFor a woman as extremely important to the Island of Britain as she is, Queen Elizabeth II could be said to have a rather boring life, if not an interesting upbringing. But she is indeed the Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. And of course, she still rules in Canada and Australia, even if old blighty has taken it's own path in recent years. She's mostly just seen as a nice old lady at best.\n\nAnd to some on the island, she's much worse. She's emblematic of everything wrong with Britain, a tired old woman as Head of State of a tired nation too tied to it's past even still. But she is still here.\n\nIn other spheres of Britain, however, the Queen and her family is to be poked fun at for all the quirks and foibles of a family whose every dysfunction is torn apart. From Harry and William's extreme independence to that "washed up old shit"/"very nice, slightly barmy old man" Charles, to his widely beloved philanthropist ex-wife Diana, the Royal Family is mocked, from Radio 4 to the more scandalous tabloids. But they are still here.\n\nWhat the Queen herself thinks, who knows? She's been around for half a century, and she'll probably be around for at least a little while longer, and she'll continue to be the face of Britain to every ill-educated American, to every incendiary Irish Republican, to every right-wing Tory crackpot with an obsession.\n\nAnd she remains.§!"
ENG_Swinson_Desc:1 "§YJo Swinson§!\n--------------\n§LWhen the Liberal candidate for the Presidency of the Commonwealth of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was announced, the majority population responded with a universal "Who?". Immediately, the BBC filled in with details.\n\nThe usual stuff. Born in Glasgow, MP for somewhere like Strathkelvin and Ross-shire or something, blah, blah, blah. As generic a liberal (Both capital and lowercase L) as one can get, without the interesting parts, like opposition to nuclear weaponry.\n\nBut she won, didn't she? She beat party legend Paddy Ashdown, and rocketed her way up the polls by the strength of... something. Maybe Britain just wanted someone boring, after years of Prime Minister Livingstone calling people Nazis. Maybe without the Queen they wanted another woman who can go around and say nice things about flowers and the weather and such.\n\nTo be fair to Jo, she doesn't exactly hide anything. Simon Hughes, Leader of the Liberals, expressed his full confidence in her presidency, saying that this is an expression of how things will go in a modern, republican Britain. So is Jo Swinson's election an expression of the future of the Liberals? Probably not. But maybe, in ten or twenty years, Jo Swinson will be beloved by the British people. A face for the republic, a new Boudicea, a female revolutionary who will bring new future to Britain.\n\nOr she'll get voted out in about ten minutes. Who's to say?§!"
ENG_Khan_Desc:1 "§YSadiq Khan§!\n--------------\n§LIf you went up to, say, Winston Churchill, and told him that in sixty or so years that a left-leaning Labour Party Muslim lawyer will have replaced the Queen as Head of State, he would scoff at you, before presumably saying some very insulting things about Muslims. But Sadiq Khan has no such time for mumbles about religion and such. He's seeking to make Britain a better place from an extremely powerless role, and fighting for peace and justice.\n\nKhan was born and raised in Tooting to a working class family of Sunni Muslims, who had arrived in London in 1968. Studying law, Khan was involved in multiple high profile discrimination cases, and was well known in Labour circles. In 2005, the MP for Tooting stepped down at risk of being deselected. Khan won the selection, and won the safe Labour seat. Charles Kennedy took a liking to Khan, and appointed him as a junior minister for Justice.\n\nA major critic of Prime Minister Livingstone, Khan ran in the presidential selection, narrowly beating former lord Neil Kinnock. He ran to victory on a campaign of peace for Britain, and despite rumblings about his religion he managed to pull through a narrow victory in the competitive race.\n\nNow, he's going to keep Livingstone in check, and hold a moral torch for Britain and the democratic world."
ENG_Clarkson_Desc:1 "§YJeremy Clarkson§!\n--------------\n§LJeremy Clarkson is a witty, witty man. Some would argue too witty. Some would call him a bastard who would take a sledgehammer to any enviromental reform if he had the chance, while some would call him that funny man from Top Gear.  Unfortunately, he is now also the President of Britain.\n\nClarkson was born in Doncaster, in Yorkshire. His family made an accidental living off of selling Paddington Bear toys, of which the selling of such became his first job. He then made a career writing on motoring in local newspapers, rising in the ranks of motoring journalism nationwide.\n\nAs Clarkson's star rose, he was recommended by a local producer to the BBC host a motoring show called Top Gear. As Top Gear gained popularity, so did Clarkson's columns. Clarkson occasionally commented on political subjects in his columns, which caused a lot of speculation about Clarkson one day pursuing a political career. He of course denied these requests.\n\nThen came the Republican affair. When Clarkson announced he was running for the presidency, the reason he gave was to "Give Ken a good kicking". A good half of the Conservative Party agreed, notably gaining the endorsement of de facto Leader of the Tory Right Nigel Farage. When he won the selection, he immediately polled ahead of the Labour and Liberal candidates due to his popularity from Top Gear, but some comments he made a long the way put a dent in his polling lead, and all of a sudden he was neck and neck.\n\nBut he pulled through in the end. Jezza always pulls through in the end, whether it's for the BBC, or for the Conservative Party.§!"
ENG_Ashdown_Desc:1 "§YPaddy Ashdown§!\n--------------\n§LJeremy "Paddy" Ashdown is a man with an extraordinary life, an extraordinary career, and honestly, it's extraordinary that he never got too far. But now, he's the President of the country he so dearly loves, and the proud keeper of British values and foreign policy nationwide, no matter what others say.\n\nBorn in New Delhi to a military family, Ashdown was mostly brought up in Northern Ireland, before gaining the nickname "Paddy" while going to school in England due to his accent. Ashdown attained a naval scholarship to pay his school fees, but left and joined the Royal Marines in 1959. Serving until 1972, he joined the elite Special Boat section (SBS).\n\n Ashdown then joined Mi6, becoming a diplomatic cover at the UN in Switzerland. Around this time, Ashdown's political allegiances flipped from the Labour Party to the fledgeling and struggling Liberal Party, which he felt inspired to assist. So, he hopped out of the intelligence business, and was selected to contest the Tory safe seat of Yeovil in Somerset. It was this early that the Liberals noticed his political skill, manuevering Labour voters into forming a united front against the Tories in Yeovil. After the sitting leader David Steel stepped down due to "feelings of extreme doubt in a Liberal future", Ashdown shockingly won the Liberal leadership. He led the Liberals to unexpected gains in Tory heartlands in the south during the Owen years, but eventually resigned when he found that Labour PM John Smith wasn't willing to work with him on electoral reform.\n\nOver twenty years later, Ashdown was the frontrunner to win the Liberal selection for the presidency, being backed by numerous Labour MPs who despised Prime Minister Livingstone. His victory is one for moderation, for sense, and most of all, for Britain.§!"
ENG_Kinnock_Desc:1 "§YNeil Kinnock§!\n--------------\n§LWhen Neil Kinnock was a child, his father told him about a Welshman, born in the same town as him, who stood up for what was right. A man of honour, filled with love for the mining men of the Welsh valleys. A man who fought for justice, before being dishonourably taken down by those who thought his vision was impossible. And ever since that day, Neil Kinnock's hero has been Aneurin Bevan, and Kinnock has tried in every way to fulfil Bevan's legacy. He failed in parliament. But as President of Britain, perhaps a brighter day can come upon the Union he so dearly loves.\n\nBorn in Tredegar, Kinnock was raised by a working class family. Recieving a diploma from University College of South Wales and Monmouthshire, he became an educator in the adult learning charity the Workers' Educational Association. Being selected for a parliamentary seat in Bedwellty, he was very quickly noticed by one Michael Foot. Foot, who both knew Bevan personally, wrote his biography and was a distinguished socialist journalist and parliamentarian, saw Kinnock, with his powerful oratory, as a possible successor to Bevan, down to the very town they were born in. Kinnock would later call Foot his greatest guide and inspiration.\n\nBecoming Education Secretary in the second Callaghan government,  his successor, David Owen, rebuked Kinnock's ambition by demoting him, out of fear of the Tribune group he was a part of. Gaining a peerage in the 1990's, Kinnock ran for the presidency after being convinced by his wife and fellow former MP Glenys Kinnock. Rumoured to be a puppet of Ken Livingstone, Kinnock's powerful speeches and his convincing rhetoric, while leading to some accusing him of being long-winded, led him to take over in the polls.\n\nKinnock is now President of Britain, and he's promised to fulfill the legacy of the Bevanites, once and for all."
ENG_May_Desc:1 "§YTheresa May§!\n--------------\n§LOh, Theresa, Theresa, Theresa. Always shooting for the top, she ended up, ironically, above it, as President of the Commonwealth. May had wanted to be first female Prime Minister since university, and instead she ended up as the first president. It's historic, but not quite what she was aiming for. Because Theresa May wanted power, power for the Conservative Party to help people find their feet. But instead, she ended up as a rubber stamp for a hated Prime Minister.\n\nMay was born to an Anglican clergyman in Eastbourne, and graduated from Oxford in 1977 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. Working briefly in the financial sector, she never made a secret of her parliamentary ambition. Eventually, she was elected to a safe seat in Berkshire, where she immediately got to work within the party. Clean it up, vote in more minority and female MPs, look very polite and clean and nice.\n\nAfter Labour's collapse at the 1997 general election, she was immediately noticed and assigned as Secretary of State for Transport. As the Clarke government ran out of steam with a thin majority during its second term, May ran to replace him, but was beaten to third place by Oliver Letwin and Nigel Farage.\n\nLetwin himself pushed her to run for the presidency, under the argument that trying to reinstate the monarchy will tire out the people. She reluctantly beat her opponent, celebrity journalist Jeremy Clarkson, and eked out a thin victory.\n\nWhat the future holds for Theresa May, who knows? But there's always the concept of resignation hanging about her, and using her experience to try and crawl back up to a place of power once more. We'll just have to wait and see.§!"
