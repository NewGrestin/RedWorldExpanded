  RWE_Utah_Heirs_to_Deseret:0 "Heirs to Deseret"
  RWE_Utah_Heirs_to_Deseret_desc:0 "§Y\"True Independence and Freedom can only exist in doing whats right.\"§!\n\nThe Salt Lake Federation is constitutionally separate from the pre-Dissolution state of Utah, Colorado and Nevada. That said, it draws origins from the provisional State of Deseret, proposed by Mormon settlers in 1849. Though the proposal was not adopted, it helped birth the modern American state of Utah, which still maintains a large population of Mormons.\n\nThe iconography of Deseret has gradually seeped back into the public mind as an effort by the nation to establish an identity independent of their origin. The official national flag was changed in 1999 following a referendum which abandoned the previous flag in favor of the current Deseret inspired derivative. The concept of this nation has seemingly caught the imagination of the Federation's people, representing a truly free and egalitarian frontier. The authoritarian UAPR to the West as further entrenched Deseretism as a concept, as proponents rallied behind the idea as a bulwark against both communism and the white nationalist states to the North.\n\n§YAs long as this national spirit is active, the Salt Lake Federation will be able to estalbish the Republic of Deseret if it obtains the states required.§!"
  RWE_Utah_LDS_Church:0 "Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints"
  RWE_Utah_LDS_Church_desc:0 "The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, or Mormon Church, is headquartered in the capital of the Salt Lake Federation in Salt Lake City. Mormon influence in the Federation is commonplace, with many in the political scene descending from Mormon families. Given the Church's more traditionalist bent, Mormon influence in the country primarily manifests in the support of conservative political movements.\n\nThe Church also works significantly throughout the American Southwest, with congregations established in Arizona, the Western Midwest states, and smaller underground groups in Eastern Nevada. In recent years, there has been a growing rift between older and newer generations of Mormons. Newer generations have become gradually more accepting of alternative lifestyles, and some have even began to adopt elements of Liberation Theology into the faith. This rift remains limited at the moment, but could become more severe as time goes on."
  RWE_Utah_Native_Management:0 "Bureau of Indian Land Management"
  RWE_Utah_Native_Management_desc:0 "Eastern Utah contains one of the three largest Indian Reservations from the Pre-Dissolution United States, the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation. Legal and jurisdiction issues plague the area due to the patchwork legislation of the United States that established it. The Federation inherited this state of affairs and spent several decades attempting to reform the Reservation into a more easily managed system."
