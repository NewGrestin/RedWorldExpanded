  GER_Refugee_Crisis:0 "Refugee Crisis"

  GER_Westalgie:0 "Westalgie"
  GER_Westalgie_desc:0 "A phenomenon prevalent since German Reunification, Westalgie is an unofficial term for the general nostalgia that many Germans carry for the former Federal Republic. This phenomena is most prevalent, as the name would imply, in the former provinces of West Germany. Many saw the unification of Germany under Marxism as an aberration, refusing to acknowledge that the Democratic Republic was now Germany's true legitimate government.\n\nThe most troubling aspect of this phenomena was its' popularity with former Bundeswehr officers, many of whom found themselves without a job after unification, and some of which continue to do so as a consequence of political unreliability. Though for the moment, Westalgie remains an amusing curiosity of Western Germany, if allowed to grow uncontrolled it could pose a serious threat to the German government."

  GER_Burden_of_History:0 "The Burdens of History"
  GER_Burden_of_History_desc:0 "\"Who are you who do not know your history?\"\n\nGermany's relationship to history is complicated, to say the least.\n\nEven in modernity, the scars of the First and Second World Wars can be acutely felt. The horrors of the Third Reich laid bare created a pervasive national trauma, maintained under West Germany's reconciliatory moves towards the rest of Europe, while the East was stripped bare by Soviet reparations. Newer generations feel this sensation less acutely, beginning to once again embrace nationalist ideas, but this remains a simmering issue for the moment.\n\nDespite the looming unpopularity of Marxism, few are willing to go so far as to return to the old ways, and barring an unmitigated catastrophe, it is unlikely Germans will easily embrace the far right again."

  GER_Southern_Separatism:0 "The Südlicher Krieg"
  GER_Southern_Separatism_desc:0 "The integration of Austria into the Democratic Republic was, for many, a catastrophe. Though on the surface, the South remains controlled, in reality Austria is a hotbed of anti-communist sentiments. The Stasi is ever present, fighting a secret war against the various Austrian independence movements of the region. A secret war which, given Austria's hostile geography, has never quite ended.\n\nEvery other week, it seems, German security forces crush an Austrian insurgent camp in the Alps, and yet no end is in sight. As soon as security forces move on, insurgents return and rebuild. Undergound networks spread capitalist propaganda, vowing that any day now, Austria will rise again and shake off the shackles of Communist oppression.\n\nThis day can never be allowed to pass."
