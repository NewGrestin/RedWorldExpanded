  RWE_Alaska_Final_Frontier:0 "The Final Frontier"
  RWE_Alaska_Final_Frontier_desc:0 "Alaska sits on the furthest frontier of the American Continent, with the northernmost parts of the country crossing the Arctic Circle. Due to the climate of the country, agriculture is extremely limited and cost of living remains high, as most needs have to be imported from outside sources.\n\nStill, Alaska remains unique as one of the few places in America still not completely conquered by man, and while the untouched beauty of the Boreal frontier draws tourists, it also brings a myriad of logistical and technological challenges."
  RWE_Alaska_Perfidious_Canucks:0 "Perfidious Ottawa"
  RWE_Alaska_Perfidious_Canucks_desc:0 "Alaska was unceremoniously broken off from the Union following the Dissolution of the United States and almost immediately fell into a humanitarian crisis. Even while a US State, Alaska was heavily reliant on imports of food, electronics and daily necessities. Now, with supply lines disrupted and the economy in shambles, Alaska was teetering on the edge of a full blown famine.\n\nCanada, either out of concern or opportunism depending on who you ask, chose to intervene and offer their economic and humanitarian support. Alaska became heavily dependent on the support of the Canadian government, and in exchange Canada acquired a certain degree of unspoken economic and by extension political control over the country. This state of affairs has kept Alaska from starving, but some feel it has instead robbed Alaska of her sovereignty as a nation. Other more radical voices push for the idea of §RAnnexationism§!, the idea that Alaska should pursue further integration with Canada, potentially even opting to become the country's eleventh province."
  RWE_Alaska_Oil_Pipeline:0 "Boreal Black Gold"
  RWE_Alaska_Oil_Pipeline_desc:0 "Alaska sits atop substantial natural resources in both crude oil and natural gas and thanks to the pre-Dissolution United States, it has the means to access and exploit it. The Trans-Alaskan Pipeline, while nowhere near as productive as concerns in the continental states, can pump hundreds of thousands of gallons of crude oil across the country.\n\nThis has, ironically, been both Alaska's boon and curse. While oil has brought wealth to some parts of the country, the importance of the pipeline has also brought foreign meddling. The Canadian government, as part of their agreements with Alaska, maintains a significant share of stock in the Alaskan National Energy Corporation, a state-run conglomerate created to manage oil and natural gas. This, coupled with Canada's already extensive economic and political influence, have become a major point of contention between Ottawa and Anchorage."
