  FRA_Politicized_Army:0 "Politicized Army"
  FRA_Politicized_Army_desc:0 "Since the inception of the French Socialist State in the 1980s, the French Army has gained a political dimension building up on its history of involvement in French politics. Immediate purges removed reactionary members of the army in the 90s as fears of a coup grew, but ever since then the army has grown to become just as important for the political scene as the national assembly. While the army has done much work to keep up its image as an unpolitical organization to the public, inside the party the military influence is far more palpable. Any big decision goes through ex-military members of the party that are directly loyal to the French high command. Bocquet, for his part, was appointed with the blessings of the French high command, as the only thing the army is interested in is the preservation of orthodox communism. \n\nThis unfortunately has left the army in a powerful spot. Where the party remains divided among the factions of independent minds, the army is fiercly loyal to the orthodox, sometimes even informing the orthodox faction of the party that they're not orthodox enough. It remains to be seen if the army would accept any diversion from the status quo."
  FRA_Refugee_Crisis:0 "The Refugee Crisis"
  FRA_Refugee_Crisis_desc:0 "The uncertainty in the Arab World, the instability in Africa and the war in Libya has led to a consistent stream of refugees fleeing their homecountry to Europe. As they reach the shores of France, our government has to quickly find answers to the issues this crisis brings, such as fulfilling the basic rights of these hundreds of refugees now on our shore. \n\nThis crisis has also become the perfect selling point for those that follow Marine le Pen's nationalist outlook philosophy in the Communist Party. Seeking to establish \"true French communism\", Le Pen has campaigned hard against the government's open border policy and seeks to rally the people of France against the government. The future will show how effective she will be in her campaign."
  FRA_Factionalism:0 "Party without Direction"
  FRA_Factionalism_desc:0 "It has been years since the French Communist Party came to power and capitalism in Europe and abroad seemed defeated. People remember the slogans that filled media at the times of the American collapse: that it was the end of history and the path to a dictatorship of the proletariat was open to be build. \n\nAnd then, it just didn't seem to happen. \n\nWithout an enemy abroad, communism sought to bring the enemy closer to home. The neighbor that didn't go voting, the teacher that questioned the authority of the party or the farmer that opposed new restrictions. The enemy became a fifth pillar, yet was so abstract that it could simply not replace the decades of anti-Americanism. The French Communist Party is a perfect reflection of this bitter truth: divided to the core on the meaning and direction of communism in the next decade, seeking to blame someone or something for the failures we still experience. With the rise of national bolshevism and reformists gaining traction, the orthodox mainstream is in danger. Experts seem to slowly shift on their perspective on the future of France, seeing it as a potential case study of how communism hasn't won against history yet. \n\nPerhaps we were wrong: history never truely ends, it only pauses for a moment."
  FRA_Under_Moscows_Thumb:0 "Under Moscow's Thumb"
  FRA_Under_Moscows_Thumb_desc:0 "When the Communist Party came to power in the '80s, France quickly turned its back to the declining global power of the United States and shook hands with Moscow, joining the Warsaw Pact. Since then, France has played a big role in coordinating the Western part of the Pact for over three decades at this point, making the French a lynchpin for the USSR in Western Europe. \n\nHowever, despite our relative importance to our comrades in Moscow, many cannot shake the feeling that France is only allowed to play this big of a role by Moscow, not due to any perceived power or importance but as a silent gift as a way to keep the nation docile. Under the thumb of Moscow, Paris was forced to sign agreement after agreement, joining the EU and staying in the Warsaw Pact even after the complete collapse of their sole enemy. As part of the larger debate on France's indirection, our relationship to Moscow is the key to truely understanding what France really wants to be in this post-history history."

  # EVENTS
  ##########################
  france.1.t:0 "The Retirement of Alain Bocquet"
  france.1.d:0 "Today, secretary-general Bocquet has handed over his letter of resignation to the National Assembly after the hours of debate finally ended. In the letter, he touches upon the past 10 years of being secretary-general, focussing on the stress it had put on him as an individual and the toll it had on his already poor health. The last few months have been the most stressful for him and many in his party, as the refugee crisis sparked by the Libyan Civil War and the untimely events in the Arab World have been questions he did not have an answer for. Thus, stressed out of his mind and feeling his poor health creeping up on him, the old secretary-general has decided to retire from public life. \n\nAfter the letter adressed to the assembly was finished by the Speaker of the House, a silence filled the room. All the representatives present today didn't seem how to feel about this event, as it came faster than most had anticipated. After 20 seconds of silence from the House, parts of the Orthodox faction stood up and applauded, while the reformists and nationalists continued their silence. \n\nQuite typical for Bocquet and everything he does, his letter did not attract public debate, yet the response to his letter did. The unity the party has fostered during Bocquet's government seems to evaporate almost immediately with the clear factionalism shown in the applause he had gotten. Many now fear the question: will the factionalism stay at simply applause or is France in for a period of political shenanigans?"
  france.1.a:0 "I leave government to enter history, yet history won't remember"
  france.2.t:0 "France declares Refugee Crisis"
  france.2.d:0 "Overburdened with the recent issues brought to France by the international refugee crisis, the French government has followed in the footsteps of the Italian government and declared a refugee crisis. More resources are allocated to dealing with the current crisis as to better help and integrate these new refugees. \n\nAlready, the action has become heavily criticized. The reformist-wing of the party has decried the use of the word crisis, arguing that the situation is currently manageable if the government acts less impulsive than it currently has done. On the other side of the aisle, Le Pen's followers have also decried the government, but for different reasons. They see the \"flooding\" of refugees into France as damaging to communism, seeing those that fled from Libya as bringers of backwards ideologies that would destroy the enlightened French-style of communism. These words have come dangerously close to reactionary argumentation according to many in the House, but Le Pen has simply been slapped on the wrist for her overt remarks about the refugees."
  france.2.a:0 "How to deal with this crisis..."
  france.3.t:0 "Le Pen criticizes Government"
  france.3.d:0 "In the wake of the refugee crisis rocking France, Le Pen has gone on record, criticizing the party and government in their dealing with the refugee crisis. Le Pen expands on her thoughts by elaborating that the French government should be less inviting of the refugees and not extend communist policy to these refugees, fearing that they will act as leaches on the communist system. While the party has condemned her criticism for the hints of racism in them, rural voters are seemingly far less concerned with these issues and have rallied around Le Pen and her faction en masse."
  france.3.a:0 "A perversion of communism is taking hold of the people"
  france.4.t:0 "Reformists appeal to French Youth"
  france.4.d:0 "With the growing faction of Le Pen gaining popularity and the inability of the party to properly deal with its problems, many younger revolutionaries have started feeling alienated from French politics. Where they once thought they could make a career in politics (or at the very least stand behind someone), they now feel like the party doesn't represent them, but only the older generations of revolutionaries. They now flock en masse to the reformists of the party under Lionel Jospin, a man who promises them the world and a bit more. \n\nThe reformists have always been popular among the students of France, yet the recent exodus from the French Communist Youth League to the more reformist-minded Young Revolutionaries of France point to a dangerous trend among younger people. With more reformist support among them, the party has set up a committee to deal with the youth problem, though some have voiced their concerns about the committee: they state that a committee made up of mainly 60+ career politicians isn't truely in touch with the youth enough to fix the party's issue. The party has heard their criticism and has thus appointed a committee responsible for overlooking any major issues with the youth issue committee."
  france.4.a:0 "Are we perhaps out of touch?"
  france.5.t:0 "Mélenchon announces Candidacy"
  france.5.d:0 "In a shocking turn of fate, Jean-Luc Mélenchon, party critic and honey of the national outlook faction, has seemingly abandoned the fringe faction of the Communist Party and adopted a more moderate approach to communism. With this new perspective on communism also came his announcement of candidacy for general-secretary, following the party line and representing the more mainstream/orthodox majority of the party. His second baptism has come seemingly at quite the great time, just a week after Bocquet resigned. Thus, members of the party have been suspicious of Mélenchon and his adoration of mainstream communism. \n\nYet, we also need to recognize the talent Mélenchon has. A demagogue true and true, this left-wing populist knows how to tackle people like Le Pen and Jospin with their own rethoric. A man like that could perhaps give the bite the mainstream needed to deal with the xenophobes and revisionists of the party before the next election."
  france.5.a:0 "Can a man truely change?"
  france.6.t:0 "Hyaric opposes Mélenchon"
  france.6.d:0 ""

  france.11.t:0 "Sins of the Father"
  france.11.d:0 "In one of her frequent media appearances, Le Pen was recently asked about her father, Jean-Marie le Pen. While initially silent on her father, Le Pen opened up during the interview, publicly denouncing her father and everything he stood for as the former leader of the Resistance Party, an underground nationalist party that did not recognize the French Socialist State as legitimate. \n\nIt has been years since the death of Jean-Marie Le Pen during a government-mandated purge of the Nationalist Party, leading to his death in a freak shoot-out between policemen and party members. Marine Le Pen would later join the Communist Party amongst heavy scrutiny for her father, yet she has been silent on him for over a decade now. While there's still debate if Le Pen goes to her father's grave every year to honour him, Le Pen has always rejected those claims and has recently tried to distance herself from her father in the public perception of her as a politician."
  france.11.a:0 "Is she truely honest?"
  france.12.t:0 "French Welfareism"
  france.12.d:0 "Proposed by none other than Le Pen, French welfareism is a popular tenet of the French national outlook faction. Based on the principle that the French and other Europeans are the only ones preserving true revolution and that the Arab world is far too filled with religion and bourgeoisie influence, French welfareism stands for a policy of only allowing French citizens access to France's extensive welfare system. While controversial at best among the party due to its ethnonationalist undertones, it has proven to be a rather popular measure among the people. With this taken in consideration, the party has contemplated and voted in favour of implementing French welfareism into the pre-existing welfare state of France, limiting access to French citizens only in this time of great crisis."
  france.12.a:0 "Doesn't sound very socialist..." 
  france.13.t:0 "Eurocare helps in Marseille" 
  france.13.d:0 "One of the top destinations for Libyan refugees, Marseille has become the place symbolic of the refugee crisis in France, with hundreds of refugees coming to the shores every week. The city, unable to solely provide support for those coming to it, has pleaded the party for national support in this crisis. \n\nThe Party, with support of the European Committee, has set up a pan-European organisation known as Eurocare, with the task of helping destination cities across the continent with aiding and providing for refugees. The new organisation, despite the investment, has proven to be quite worth it in the city of Marseille, as refugees now have temporary shelter, food and other basics while they await eventual government support and establish themselves in our society as hard-working comrades."
  france.13.a:0 "A resounding succes!" 
  france.14.t:0 "Dealing with the Housing Issue" 
  france.14.d:0 "France has had a big housing issue for some time now, due to the slow construction of new houses compared to the growth of the French population. While government intervention has helped relatively great with aiding those affected by the housing crisis, the actual issue of few houses has yet to be solved. Thus, Le Pen has pushed a proposal together with members of the orthodox wing of the party to combat the housing issue by giving French citizens the privilige to get a home quicker. This plan contrasts reformist ideas, which plead for better contstruction planning and districting in cities to quicken construction of new houses and increase the amount of housing available at a given time. Their plans have fallen on deaf ears however, as the party has gone with Le Pen's and Hyaric's all-French Housing plan."
  france.14.a:0 "A roof for me, but not for thee" 
  france.15.t:0 "Reformists Plan Adopted" 
  france.15.d:0 "After hours of debate on the issue of housing in France for both French citizens and refugees, the reformists have won out and led to the party adopting a new idea for adressing the issue. The \"roofs for refugees\" plan tries to tackle both issues by increasing the speed at which housing is constructed. By loosening construction legislation and promoting high-rise housing, the plan hopes to fill the housing gap currently plagueing many French cities. While popular among the reformists and the party, the national outlook faction has been vocally opposed to it, with some members going so far as to call it "unpatriotic" and "unrevolutionary", which are considered serious accusations." 
  france.15.a:0 "Some heart and soul in our politics" 

  newsrw.25.t:0 "France leaves the Warsaw Pact"
  newsrw.25.d:0 "Recent development in France has caught the eyes of international observers across Europe. With the recent resignation of former secretary-general Bocquet and the pressure applied on the Communist Party to hold a referendum on France's Warsaw Pact membership, the government had no choice but to accept the proposal of a Warsaw Pact referendum. Yet, despite high hopes from the same government that the people of France would reject this nationalistic idea, the anti-Warsaw campaign was able to effectively mobilize a large portion of the French electorate, leading to a clear majority for leaving the Warsaw Pact this week. \n\nCornered by the referendum and the various nationalistic factions in the national assembly, the government was forced to accept the results, leading to France leaving the Warsaw Pact behind. Already, the figures in the anti-Warsaw campaign are enjoying their time in the spotlight after this political victory, with names like Le Pen and Jospin gaining nationwide popularity."

  POLITICS_BOCQUET_DESC:0 "Ask anyone what they think about general-secretary of the French Communist Party Alain Bocquet and general indifference will meet your ears. For a man that was in charge of the party during one of the most important decades of the Warsaw Pact, overseeing the failure of capitalism worldwide, Bocquet himself has done generally nothing to reap the benefits of that collapse for France, which has given the ammo needed to the party's counter-movement of National Outlook thought. \n\nYet, despite this perception of this unhealthy general-secretary, Bocquet hasn't been completely useless to France. He has kept the boat of the Communist Party relatively stable, never involved in any personal drama or scandal and quickly responding to potential threats to the party with expulsion. With less than glamerous laws under his belt, mainly tackling tax legislature and tax fraud, Bocquet isn't going to be the man that France will remember for the fall of capitalism, but, for Bocquet, not being remembered for your victories is superiour to being remembered for your failures."
