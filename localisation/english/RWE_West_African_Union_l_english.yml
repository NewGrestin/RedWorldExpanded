  WAF_The_Tin_Pot_Despot_desc:0 "Maïnassara is for many outside of West Africa the stereotypical tin pot despot of the African continent. A man of the military with a streak of slight incompetence, he remains in power solely due to his oppressive policies meant to keep opposition down. Yet the opposition he should fear most is not the one from other parties, but from the army."

  WAF_The_Arab_Among_Africans_desc:0 "Aziz wasn't the first pick of the army, nor is he the man with the most connections in it. But, despite all of that, he is the man that now sits on the West African throne. With much to be done, the army does not care for the moment that an Arab rules a mostly black African nation."
  WAF_Pamper_the_Commanders:0 "Spoil Our Army"
  WAF_Pamper_the_Commanders_desc:0 "The army is the mightiest pillar of any regime. It alone makes or breaks it, like the Preatorian Guard of Old Rome. Thus, we need to spoil the army as much as we can as to keep them on our sides. We must not forget: Ibrahim was killed for his lack of presents to the military."
  WAF_Lap_of_Luxury:0 "Gifts to our Highest Commanders"
  WAF_Lap_of_Luxury_desc:0 "The men in power in our army are the one's we need on our side. They are those the soldiers are loyal to and they can just as easily erase Aziz if they wanted. Thus, Aziz has to actively pamper these high commanders, keeping them on his good side, if he wants to survive the next decade."
  WAF_Yachts_for_the_Navy:0 "Yachts for the Loyal"
  WAF_Yachts_for_the_Navy_desc:0 "A yacht is an incredible gift, but it is also expensive. Let us give some of these expensive gifts only to those who are as loyal as one can be to the government. Some Pavlovian techniques can perhaps shape the army-government relations for the better."
  WAF_Bribe_Bureaucrats:0 "Bribe Our Bureaucrats"
  WAF_Bribe_Bureaucrats_desc:0 "Corruption is an art few can understand. The language of money is subtle and dangerous, easily turned against its user if publicly found out. However, it's also the language and art that makes bureaucrats fight and work. To give some good bonusses to those that work hard (or to give bonusses as to make them work hard) will help the nation, right?"
  WAF_Punish_Low_Ranked_Crime:0 "Tough on Low-Ranking Crimes"
  WAF_Punish_Low_Ranked_Crime_desc:0 "While we can allow much of the higher command to be as corrupt as they want to be, corruption in the lower ranks is far less acceptable for our regime. The selling of weapons on the black market, the bribing of local police officers and the purchasing of illegal substances by soldiers shall be punished with extreme prejudice."
  WAF_Allow_Corruption:0 "Kleptocracy as an Ideology"
  WAF_Allow_Corruption_desc:0 "Critics often use the term \"kleptocracy\" as a bad word, to point at poor government that are far more open of their understanding of the language of corruption. Yet, they are totally wrong, as usual. Kleptocracy isn't a problem, it's a state of mind, a point of view even. It's the ideology that runs dictatorships across the globe and keeps despots healthy."
  WAF_Unify_the_Government:0 "Reform the Government"
  WAF_Unify_the_Government_desc:0 "The governing of government has been neglected for decades by the army and its puppets. Basic tasks of government, such as providing the people with their basic needs and keeping the cities working, have become rarities. Heavy reform is needed and a more iron hand can push the nation in the right direction."
  WAF_Appease_Provincial_Councils:0 "Appease the Provincial Councils"
  WAF_Appease_Provincial_Councils_desc:0 "Big government is problematic. It is inefficient and leads to unwanted corruption. Instead, we seek to provide more autonomy to the provincial councils, as a way to keep them and the citizens happy. As long as it isn't the job of Niamey to provide, the people won't bother us."
  WAF_Decentralized_Philosophy:0 "Decentralize the Union"
  WAF_Decentralized_Philosophy_desc:0 "The West African Union has become far too centralized in the eyes of Aziz. Why does one government need to do so much, if we have a thousands smaller governments that are able to run the local affairs perfectly fine?"
  WAF_Opposition_in_our_Pocket:0 "The Pocket Opposition"
  WAF_Opposition_in_our_Pocket_desc:0 "While we have given more autonomy to the provinces, this has come at the cost of empowering local opposition movements. These movements aren't problematic yet, but can grow more dangerous in the future. Thus, by using bribes, intimidation and other authoritarian tactics, we can keep them in our pockets and neuter them before they grow too big for their boots."

  RWE_WAF_Post_Coup_Aftermath_desc:0 "The country remains shaken by the aftermath of the 2008 attempted coup d'état. Members of the military, mainly from Burkina Faso, had conspired to remove Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara for his favouring of the Mauritanian and Niger militaries in the annual military budget. With a small force marching upon Niamey, the coup was almost fatal for Ibrahim, as the presidential guard was on the brink of switching allegiance to the conspiracy. Yet the coup attempt failed when the federal army blasted them apart with support of the airforce, leaving the coup with any armed backing and the generals open to be arrested. The following trials would severly neuter the Burkina Faso army for its attempted coup. \n\nYet Burkina Faso wasn't the only nation of the four to feel the coup's aftermath. Large parts of civil society still are shaken by the bloody memories of the coup. Photographs of the conclusion of the Niamey battle still are popular among gore hounds and teenagers on the world wide web for the sheer brutality of the reprisal and many men and women have lost a partner in either the coup or the following trials, which led to the execution of thousands of supposed conspiracy loyalists. It will take a long time for the West African Union to heal from its wounds."

  rw_waf.1.t:0 "In the Halls of Naimey"
  rw_waf.1.d:0 "For the people, the memories of the 2008 coup may be haunting, scarring even. But for the military, it is simply a memory of failure. 2008 was supposed to bring an end to the shambles of the Maïnassara government, one unable to truly cooperate with the army beyond superficial budget increases. No fine wining and dining, no expensive yachts as gifts nor even a single trip to New York for his most loyal comrades. It couldn't go on any longer like this. \n\nThe army had thus found another man to rally behind, one that would not follow in the footsteps of the failure of Blaise Compaoré in 2008: Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. One of the main advisors of Maïnassara and a staunch Arab ally of the West African construct, Aziz would be the safest choice for the army to use this year. \n\nYet, while some of the conspiracy members pat themselves on their backs while planning out the next coup d'état, a young soldier overhears them from the room. While this is treason of the highest order against the Union, rattling on his bosses would just as easily be classified as treason if the coup would succeed. And perhaps it might. Conflict tears him apart. \n\nShould he tell anyone?"
  rw_waf.1.a:0 "The boy choose safety and kept his mouth shut"
  rw_waf.1.b:0 "The boy choose loyalty and told a presidential friend"
  rw_waf.2.t:0 "The May Day Coup"
  rw_waf.2.d:0 "Boots on the streets of Niamey! the army has betrayed the trust of Maïnassara for a third time and now seeks to depose him once more. Swiftly, Maïnassara demands his phone and calls the head of the Niger armed forces who are also stationed in the city. Picking up is the commander, who clears up that he has remained loyal to the president of the union. More information follows, as the presidential guard remains on the sidelines, having yet to choose who will come out on top during this week. Fuming, Maïnassara asks the commander if he can repell these forces. \n\nThe commander responds:"
  rw_waf.2.a:0 "They outnumber our troops, we are no match"
  rw_waf.2.b:0 "We are in a bad position, but we can still win this battle with enough blood!"
  rw_waf.2.c:0 "We already knew of the coup president, the rest of the federal army will clean them up!"
  rw_waf.3.t:0 "Chaos in Mauritania"
  rw_waf.3.d:0 "In the wake of the failed coup of Mohamed Abdel Aziz, the provinces of the union have experienced riots and other forms of chaos. Local militaries are having trouble containing most of the anarchy, but the news from Mauritania has clearly painted a more depressing picture than the other 3 states. \n\nIn Mauritania, the pan-Arab National Vanguard Party of Gadaffi-loyalist Mohamed Yahdhih Ould Ibrid El Leil has condemned the military government and supported the coup planners, inviting these traitors to Mauritania as a way to hide from Maïnassara's wrath. His attempts have been an unfortunate success, with even the coup leader Aziz now having returned to Dakar. The situation in the province is growing grimmer every minute, as today the local army has pledged loyalty to the province and the National Vanguard Party. The threat of pan-Arabism is very much alive in this little corner of the federation and it threatens to currently throw the entire system into chaos. An emergency council has already been established in Niamey, tasked to solve the increasingly complex issue of Mauritania, perhaps with violence if needed."
  rw_waf.3.a:0 "Just like that, Mauritania is on fire..."
  rw_waf.7.t:0 "The People against the People's Party" 
  rw_waf.7.d:0 "The recent May Day Coup has broken apart much of the legitimacy of our old government. While Maïnassara's government was brutal and repressive, it still could sometimes hide behind the veil of \"democratic legitimacy\", due to its rigged elections and allowance of a puppet opposition. Yet, these measures have dissapeared with the military coup. Parliament has been closed, much of the opposition now spends its time behind bars and Maïnassara himself died trying to flee the country. The situation has turned the atmosphere in West Africa tense, as extremist opposition parties grow under our new regime. People have opened their eyes and have been personally affected by our badly executed coup: some have lost loved ones, others have become impoverished in the aftermath. \n\nThese kinds of disillusionments have the Communist Party and other revolutionaries in much of West Africa and it has forced our new junta to take decisive actions before our nation falls to a wave of communist sympathisers and Soviet spies."
  rw_waf.7.a:0 "A junta is completely democratic!"
  rw_waf.8.t:0 "The Return of Democracy"
  rw_waf.8.d:0 "Today, in a televised announcement to the entirety of the West African Union, chairman Aziz made the promise of a return to normalcy in government and state, promising that the military junta was only temporary and that the next legislative election would be held this year. \n\nThe announcement for new elections has been celebrated across the nation, with some seeing it as a return to the old order under Maïnassara. Yet, while they celebrate, much of the (legal) opposition has spoken out against Aziz and his promise, suspecting that the chairman is trying to fool the country in a false sense of security while preparing to rig the next election. The Communist Party leadership has thus already told its supporters to boycot the next election."
  rw_waf.8.a:0 "Could have gone better..."
  rw_waf.9.t:0 "Lessons from Libya"
  rw_waf.9.d:0 "With our recent decision to keep much of the communist and socialist leadership in jail having led to nation-wide protests and general unrest, chairman Aziz has turned to his desk to figure out the next step towards succes. After weeks of planning, a strategy has been envisioned by him and the military leadership, heavily borrowed from Libya's Arab dictator, Gadaffi. \n\nAziz seeks to introduce a similair system of \"local council democracy\" to the West African Union, hoping that it can veil the shortcomings of the military junta behind a veil of democratic practices and strongman illiberalism. These ideas are coupled with a series of brutal crackdowns against the opposition, seeking to properly wipe out the communist party and establish a full dictatorship in the same spirit as Gadaffi's Libyan dictatorship. Aziz has proudly presented the plan to the rest of his loyalists."
  rw_waf.9.a:0 "Gadaffi knew how to hold onto power. We can learn from him."
  rw_waf.10.t:0 "Red Cross helps in Mali"
  rw_waf.10.d:0 "The recent conflict between Mali and local islamist factions has caused many civilians to lose their homes, lose loved ones and lose appendages in the fight. With many local refugees now without food, water or proper healthcare, we have turned to a variety of international NGOs to help our government in caring for the sick and dying. The Red Cross heads this group of NGOs, helping Malian doctors in the field with European medical supplies, while NGOs like Humanity United have helped the local munincipalities with the food situation of the refugees and locals. These NGOs have slightly legitimized our government in both the eyes of those who had to flee and the international community."

  newsrw.13.d:0 "West Africa has never been known as a bedrock of stability. Ever since the unification of Niger, Burkina Faso, Mali and Mauritania, instability has plagued this Frankenstein federation. The most recent president of the union, Ibrahim Baré Maïnssara, was himself very much the product of this instability, coming to power through a military coup. Yet the coup leader would soon face other factions inside the army himself, with a coup in 1991 and 2008 both trying to depose the West African dictator. \n\nWhile the army of Burkina Faso was purged in the aftermath of 2008, further inaction now proves to have been fatal for the Maïnassara regime, as another coup led by Mauritanian marshal Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz has taken control of the capital and the old despot of West Africa has been killed in the action while trying to escape. The new situation seems to have put the nation on the brink of collapse, as the very Arab Aziz now rules over a nation of Africans, with many hostile to this rather foreign figure leading the country."

  newsrw.14.d:0 "The West African Union has never been a very stable state, even in African terms of stability. Yet this week, the military tried once again to depose the almost 20 year sitting dictator of the federation, Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara. The coup, however, ran into a wall when it became clear that the government had expected an attempt, leading to mass arrests and a general purge of the military high command. \n\nMany of the coup leaders were military men, dissatisfied with the Maïnassara regime and its inability to properly spoil the army and its commanding officers. While military budget increased every year, the gifts Maïnassara's regime had previously given to the high command slowly became less and less expensive, leading to some of them turning their backs on Maïnassara. Others, on the other hand, were motivated by removing the West African despot from his throne, seeing him as far too lenient on communism in the country and the recent foreign policy shift towards Soviet reconciliation."

The military, while previously claiming to protect the president against the protests, has turned its back on Maïnassara's regime and allowed the protests to reach parliament and the lavish house of the dictator himself. Hours after reaching Maïnassara's house, reports came in that a helicopter had transported the petty despot to Switzerland, leaving his regime to fall. \n\nWith the atmosphere in Niamey now jubulent about the fall of one of Africa's longest governing dictators, much will need to be done to ensure a smooth democratic transition. The military remains a very volatile element in this entire scenario, as it has shown itself to often betray those it has supported in the past. It remains to be seen if the new West African Union will bring democracy back to the federation."

  newsrw.16.d:0 "The recent reintroduction of democracy in the West African Union hasn't been the smoothest process, with the military often interfering with the democratic transition and forcing compliance with the threats of another coup. Yet the situation may now turn truly dangerous with the recent victory of the Marxist-Leninist Party of Oumar Mariko, one of the few parties that has expressed extreme hostility towards cooperation with the West African military. \n\nMariko himself has been an important figure during the protests that deposed Maïnassara and gained a remarkable following from there, popularizing the marxist-leninist party as a mainstream party. The eventual transition to democracy would further Mariko's image as a man of the people, often sparking conflict with the military and opposing any cooperation with the armed institution during the transition. With his victory, West Africa seems to be heading towards a bloody conflict. Either the military will stand down and allow Mariko to govern as he sees fit, or Mariko will have a potential coup on his hands"

  newsrw.17.d:0 "A shocking turn of events has hit the West African Union like a train, as its tin pot despot, Ibrahim Baré Maïnassara, follows in the footsteps of the old Central African dictator Bokassa, deciding to call himself sultan of a new West African Empire. \n\nThe announcement from Niamey has turned heads across the globe, as the human-rights violating despot of West Africa hasn't made much friends in recent years. While initially on a course of reconciliation with the Soviet Union, Maïnassara dropped his plans after the attempted coup in 2010. Since then, domestic purges have cleaned much of the army from the old coup planners and has empowered Maïnassara to almost monarch-like levels, so this coronation does seem to fit his status in West Africa. With now a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand, Ibrahim I will seek to expand his influence in a rather swift manner, battling against Soviet neo-colonialism and the pan-Arabist threat of Northern Africa."

Already, the troubled province of Burkina Faso has split off from the old union, leaving Mali and Niger in a shaky federation of equals with the army in total control. The remains of the federation has made a temporary peace deal with the Mauritanian rebels as it now faces a Tuareg insurgency in Northern Mali. \n\nWith the fall of the West African Union, experts fear the worst for the region in the coming years. A now extremist Mauritania is in the grip of the Neo-Ba'athist plague, while Burkina Faso seems to face its own share of very threatening problems, with local communist groups attempting to seize power in the unstable state. All in all, it seems that even the bad situation of the Maïnassara regime was nothing compared to the current situation."

Using the opportunity that had been presented, the Tuaregs of Northern Mali organized under the banner of the nation of Azawagh as the Tuareg People's Liberation Front, challenging Maïnassara's authority of the Sahara. With the Mali-Niger Union now on its knees, the Tuaregs have been able to secure their independence from their African occupation, proclaiming a new Tuareg state known as Azawagh in Northern Mali. \n\nThe defeat of the Union army has also strained relations between the pillars of the old West African Union, as both Mali and Niger now seek to go their separate ways, disbanding this last remnant of the old West African Union. With it, it seems that West Africa returns to the old status quo of nation-states, rejecting the unification of the region under one flag."

Backed by discontent military commanders wanting a government that has far less influence in the army, the coup met much resistance in the capital of Niamey, where the local garrison remained loyal to the president and was able to keep the conspiracy loyalists outside the city before the federal army was mobilized. The following bloodbath would cost the lives of many West African soldiers and civilians due to the urban combat. \n\nWith the traitors and their armies now facing a very strong enemy, many of them have now fled to the fringe province of Mauritania under the leadership of Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz, a previous Arab military advisor to Maïnassara. This army of Aziz loyalists now seeks to establish a mutual relationship with the local ba'athist government that had won the Mauritanian election last year."

Yet, while the Gaddafist system has suffered in Libya, the West African Union under Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz has gone and adopted a similair form of Third International Theory, proclaiming a new West African Jamahiriya that follows in the footsteps of the great Gaddafi. \n\nThe actions of Aziz has caused confusion internationally and domestically, with few truly understanding what the end goal is for the new Brotherly Leader. Some speculate that Aziz has turned to Gaddafism to legitimize his rule and fill the void left by the May Day coup. Others seem to deem Aziz's turn to Gaddafism as a way for the new West African despot to pick up the leadership of the Third World against the new Soviet order, having come to power in a very much anti-Soviet atmosphere."

The aggressive posturing of the West African Union in particular has pushed away many of the West African gulf states from Niamey and towards more cooperation between the ideological different states of the region. This all has culminated into the formation of a military alliance between the nations of West Africa, calling itself the \"West African Containment Group\", with the explicit goal of keeping the West African Union of [WAF.GetLeader] in check. \n\nThe formation of this new alliance has shaken the region of West Africa to its core, as military confrontation between the West African Union and the other local powers, such as Nigeria and Benin, now seems inevitable. Already, the foreign minister of West Africa has heavily criticized the formation of this new organisation, deeming it provocation against the West African Union and a potential threat to the sovereignty of the Union in the near future."

With one of the continent's strongest armies and a young, yet growing economy, West Africa has formalized the Bamaka Security Pact with the other despots of Africa, seeking to secure the continent's future against communism. \n\nThe formation of the Bamako Security Pact has left much of the world shocked. A nation that once seemed on the brink of collapse was not only able to pull itself together, but contest against a multitude of third world countries for the title of the leader of the third world, cementing its dominance in Africa with the Bamako Pact. Already, international observers follow this development critically. With West Africa becoming another contender on the stage of Africa, a regional, perhaps even continental, conflict is starting to seem inevitable. Perhaps, a new continental order will reshape Africa in the near future."

Experts currently believe that the Union's nuclear arsenal is still relatively primitive, but could soon become a major threat for Africa, the Middle East and Southern Europe if testing continued. Already, much of the international community has been outraged by West Africa's nuclear announcement, but sanctions have yet to be placed on this new pariah state in the making. \n\nWhatever the international community does, the clock is heading closer to midnight."

The results of this long period of talking: the unification of the two democratic, non-communist nations under the banner of the East African Federation. \n\nBoth Tanzania and Kenya are weird examples of democratic nations in Central-Africa that resisted the communist tide during the Cold War and its aftermath. Yet, while the anti-communist regimes of nations like Central Africa, Burundi and Rwanda aren't known to be shining beacons of democracy, both in Kenya and Tanzania, the established parties were able to keep the communist parties from entering parliament in any meaningfull capacity. With the growing pressure from the communist-dominated African Union and the general tension among the nations of the continent, the East African Federation is very much a decision born out of preservation, as the ever encroaching phantom of communisms continues to be a threat."

In the middle of this all, the West African Union stands alone. Too authoritarian to join the democratic powers left after the '80s, yet far too reactionary to join forces with the Moscow communists. \n\nAbandoned by the new world order and threatened by the growing pan-Arabist threat of the North, West Africa will have to carve its own path and destiny.
