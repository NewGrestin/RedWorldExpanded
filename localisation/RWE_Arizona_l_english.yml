  RWE_America_Arizona_Hoover_Dam:0 "The Hoover Dam"
  RWE_America_Arizona_Hoover_Dam_desc:0 "During the Dissolution of the United States, many major monuments and infrastructure sources became battlefields, and few were as critical as the Hoover Dam. One of the most impressive technological marvels of the pre-Collapse United States, Hoover Dam provided a critical water reservoir and electricity to much of the Southwest United States.\n\nFollowing the Dissolution, Hoover Dam became a battlefield between the forces of the newly established Arizona Republic and the United American People's Republics, with the former supported by Utah and Midwestern States. Over thirty years have passed since the Battle for Hoover Dam, and the UAPR did not retreat. Across the river, it gathers strength, and the connection between the Arizona and Nevadan portions of the Dam have become one of the most heavily militarized borders in the region, with the Anti-Communist Utah and Midwest States actively supporting Arizona's National Guard to prevent the UAPR from securing such a critical piece of Southwest Infrastructure."

One of the most impressive technological marvels of the pre-Collapse United States, Hoover Dam provided a critical water reservoir and electricity to much of the Southwest United States.\n\nFollowing the Dissolution, Hoover Dam became a battlefield between the forces of the newly established Arizona Republic and the United American People's Republics, with the former supported by fascists in Utah and Midwestern States. The American Revolutionary Forces fought to reclaim the Dam for the peoples of the new Union, but ultimately were unable to push the Arizonan army back across the Dam. Now, the border across the Dam remains heavily militarized, as the fascist Arizonan army attempts to stop the people from retaking that which is rightfully theirs. "
  RWE_Arizona_Red_Scare:0 "The Arizona Red Scare"
  RWE_Arizona_Red_Scare_desc:0 "Following the Dissolution of the United States, the Republic of Arizona found itself bordering one of the most militarily prominent Post American Nations. The Union of American People's Republics established itself in 1987, and promptly made itself an existential threat to every nation to its' East. Arizona was offered membership in the country, but ultimately refused in what would best be described as \"strong terms\".\n\nIn the intervening years, the UAPR and Arizona would have a series of minor military engagements over control of Hoover Dam and various strategic border points. The situation has manifested in strong anti-Communist sentiment in Arizona, particularly from the paramilitary Arizona National Guard Corps. In spite of this, the Arizona Communist Party remains an inexplicable force in the nation's politics, mainly as a result of Party Chair Sinema's denouncement of Angela Davis. Arizona remains a country with a conservative bent, and certain elements may react violently to the rise of left wing politics."
  RWE_Arizona_National_Guard:0 "The Arizona National Guard Corps"
  RWE_Arizona_National_Guard_desc:0 "Despite the name, the Arizona National Guard Corps are not an official branch of the Republic's military or government. The aftermath of the Dissolution left many in the American military upended and without work. While most reintegrated into the civilian population without incident, some were drawn into paramilitary organizations that offered promises of stability or radical ideologies.\n\nThe Guard Corps were one such group, formed from the remnants of the Arizona National Guard before it was formally dissolved and integrated as part of the Territorial Army. The group is primarily lead by Joe Arpaio, former soldier and multi-time elected Sheriff of Maricopa County. Arpaio's tenure as head of the organization has seen it realign and rebrand as a Veteran's lobby in the Arizona Senate, however the paramilitary past of the group never truly faded. Having fought in the Auxillary Corps during the brief Hoover Dam War, Arpaio enjoys significant support from Arizona conservatives, although some of his supporters seem concerningly more enthusiastic than the Sheriff himself."
  RWE_Arizona_Mexicanification:0 "Mexican Economic Influence"
  RWE_Arizona_Mexicanification_desc:0 "Arizona's geography precludes it from being truly economically independent. With hostilities with the UAPR still fresh, Arizona is forced to rely on trade primarily through Mexico, Utah and the Midwest States. Out of these three, Mexico maintains the greatest influence. Arizona has always maintained a significant hispanic majority, much to the chagrin of the country's right wing parties. Despite this, the dominance of Mexican imports and the gradual devaluation of the Arizona Dollar have forced most parties to accept the economic control Mexico maintains over Phoenix.\n\nMore importantly, Mexico's incursions to the East demonstrated a clear willingness to militarily intervene in the post-American order. With their Southern neighbor being so influential and significantly better armed, it would be less than healthy for Arizona's government to antagonize the country's Hispanic community."
