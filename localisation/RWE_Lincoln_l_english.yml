  LIN_Cement_the_Leadership_Principle_desc:0 "One of the core tenets of the Workers' Party's revolution is the following: \n\n\"The revolution can only be accomplished by a vanguard. This vanguard can only lead the revolution if its led by a capable leader. Thus, the leader is the true revolution\"."
  LIN_Introduce_National_Bolshevism:0 "Introduce National Bolshevism"
  LIN_Introduce_National_Bolshevism_desc:0 "The roots of National Bolshevism are located in Eastern Europe, which has left the West without any truely important voices supporting this ideology. Especially Americans have remained ignorant about the glorious revolution. The Union is thus tasked with introducing the common American to National Bolshevism."
  LIN_Embrace_Horseshoe_Theory:0 "Embrace the Horseshoe"
  LIN_Embrace_Horseshoe_Theory_desc:0 "The horseshoe theory was once meant to protect the liberal status quo, calling the extreme right and extreme left alike and thus not really something revolutionary, deminishing the actual values of those ideologies. However, like many things, what was once meant to mock and demean will be turned into a sign of our struggle and victory. We will embrace the horseshoe as much as it embraces the revolution."
  LIN_The_Visionary_Marx:0 "Our Visionary Marx"
  LIN_The_Visionary_Marx_desc:0 "The writings of Karl Marx lay the foundation for the economically left-wing policies of the Union. While much of the original meaning of Marx has been twisted by Moscow, Beying and Berlin, Spokane will remain a stronghold for what Marx truely meant when he talked about revolution." 
  LIN_The_Messiah_Mussolini:0 "Our Messiah Mussolini"
  LIN_The_Messiah_Mussolini_desc:0 "The face of fascism, Benito Mussolini has laid the foundations upon which we stand today. A revolutionary to its core that embraces the true syncretic meaning of revolution and Marx's words, Mussolini is an idol to our Union and should be glorified by every man, woman and child."
  LIN_Crush_the_Peoples_Opium:0 "Collapse the Big Church"
  LIN_Crush_the_Peoples_Opium_desc:0 "Karl Marx once called religion the \"opium of the masses\". He was right. Religion and its soft morality distract the American people from the historical importance of this revolution. The Soft Influence of the Papal States in this Union should not be tolerated and a larger campaign should try and end religion in our nation."
  LIN_Strict_Government_Education:0 "Revolutionary Youth Education"
  LIN_Strict_Government_Education_desc:0 "Children are easy to mold into our ideals. Without a true grasp of the world and their innocence that allows them to believe anything that is told to them by an authority figure, children should become the true focus of our revolution. Education thus turns into a tool, namely the tool with which we mold these minds into revolutionaries."
  LIN_Ban_Anti_Revolutionary_Literature:0 "Establish \"Summer Camps\""
  LIN_Ban_Anti_Revolutionary_Literature_desc:0 "It has turned out that many Americans remain stubborn. Born during ages of democracy and liberalism, their minds have been rotted by these concepts of \"civil and political rights\". Thus, state-sponsored \"summer camps\" have been opened across the Rocky Mountains for adults that are deemed \"creative enough for camp\"."

The threat of religion will remain if it's allowed to even be mentioned among our people. Thus, new laws will be put in place that criminalizes the spreading of religion, starting with mentioning the concept of God."
  LIN_Ban_Holy_Scriptures:0 "Ban any Holy Scripture"
  LIN_Ban_Holy_Scriptures_desc:0 "Every disease has its host and for the disease of religion, the holy scriptures are the hosts.

  RWE_LIN_Fractured_Right_Wing:0 "Fractured Alt-Right"
  RWE_LIN_Fractured_Right_Wing_desc:0 "The American Alt-Right has, ironically, always been quite a diverse bunch of characters. Ranging from white-supremacists and neo-fascists to pagans and conspiracy theorists, the Alt-Right has never truely been unified behind one ideology. Despite the differences, however, many of these people did unify shortly after the failure of the American experiment, leaving their hometowns to support the creation of a white ethnostate in the north. \n\nThose memories have long been gone. The seccession of Montana from the Midwestern Union was a shortlived victory for the American Alt-Right, as factionalism fractioned the state. Many of the younger men that had rebuild in Montana weren't attracted by the old fascist rethoric of Covington, instead supporting new ideas imported from Europe and Canada, such as national bolshevism and its main proponent in Montana, Richard B. Spencer. Espousing a strictly American version of national bolshevism, Spencer was able to entice much of these younger alt-righters, leading to the fracturing of the Montana ethnostate. Allied to his left and right-wing allies, Spencer formed the Workers' Party and proclaimed a new dawn for the American alt-right, kickstarting the civil war in Montana."
  RWE_LIN_Ideological_Enigma:0 "An Ideological Enigma"
  RWE_LIN_Ideological_Enigma_desc:0 "Mixing Marxist theory, the teachings of Hitler, the philosophy of Mussolini and the government-style of Stalin, Richard Spencer's national bolshevism is an ideological enigma to most of America. \n\nThe introduction of a new, revolutionary ideology is never easy and Spencer's national bolshevism is the first of its ideological type to touch the shores of the former United States. However, unlike ideologies before it that ignited revolution after revolution, national bolshevism has many gaps in its theory, often leading to incoherent ideology and politics. That's not even mentioning the issue of allegiance to national bolshevism found in the Union of Lincoln, as the alt-right looks at it with paranoid disdain and the radical left denounces it as filthy nazism. With an incoherent ideology and few people actually aligned to the teachings preached by Richard Spencer, it's not an enigma why national bolshevism has yet to gain traction among the American populace."

  RWE_LIN_Christian_Exodus:0 "Christian Exodus"
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Exodus_desc:0 "Our harsh policy on religion has led to many on the christian right fleeing the Union of Lincoln, trying to find shelter in other states, even to communist, godless California. This exodus causes tremendous issues."
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Refugee_Camps:0 "Christian Refugee Camps"
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Refugee_Camps_desc:0 "The Union of Lincoln has recently cracked down upon all forms of religion, leading to a large-scale exodus of many religious people, especially former christian allies of the Spencerite regime. Fleeing persecution, many of them are forced to reside in large refugee camps on our border."

  RWE_LIN_Revolutionary_Determinism:0 "Spencerite Determinism"
  RWE_LIN_Revolutionary_Determinism_desc:0 "People seem to think that history is simply a series of events that happened by chance. History, to them, is nothing more than a gamble, a game of luck. They fail to understand that this simply isn't the case, as history has always walked the same, determined path towards revolution. Convinced that history is determined in favour of revolution, the Union has proclaimed Spencer the successor of the original founding fathers and his revolution the spiritual follow-up of the American Revolution."
  RWE_LIN_White_Socialism:0 "White Socialism"
  RWE_LIN_White_Socialism_desc:0 "The meaning of socialism has been hijacked by the Soviets, the American Communist Party and many other entities across the globe to mean something that supports the equality of races. Their use of the word is rejected by our wise supreme chief, who has chosen to introduce true socialism to America as part of the larger national bolshevik revolution. Socialism, but only for the white man."
  RWE_LIN_Statue_Costs:0 "Costs of the New Lincoln Memorial"
  RWE_LIN_Statue_Costs_desc:0 "Our great leader makes no mistakes, but the cost of the recently unveiled Lincoln memorial has made some party members question if the supreme chief is aware of the financial costs of his vanity projects."
  RWE_LIN_Surpressing_Creativity:0 "Surpressed Anti-State Creativity"
  RWE_LIN_Surpressing_Creativity_desc:0 "Creativity has become another one of those buzzwords used by democrats, progressives and liberals, sugercoating the reality. Creativity isn't something to strive for, but simply an annoyance to the people and the state. Some forms of creativity are even dangerous and are thus actively surpressed among the younger generations and the \"traditionally creative\" communities, such as the arts and academia."
  RWE_LIN_Inspired_by_Marx:0 "Twisting Marx's Words"
  RWE_LIN_Inspired_by_Marx_desc:0 "A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism. \n\nMarx never meant this as a positive. His words actively warned the great thinkers of those times of the coming Russian storm. His words, twisted by socialists and communists, will be untwisted by the puritan and anti-revisionist national bolshevik revolution, potentially by force."
  RWE_LIN_Religious_Crackdown:0 "Collapsing the Big Church"
  RWE_LIN_Religious_Crackdown_desc:0 "Once something that unified the white American people against non-whites, christianity has turned into something despicable according to supreme chief Spencer. A religion that tries to push its moral code as an universalizing code cannot be tolerated by this new political wave and, according to Spencer, is a potential threat. Thus, the big church has to crack and collapse before the revolution's spirit is broken by this anti-white conspiracy named religion."

  RWE_LIN_Elusive_War_Funding:0 "Unorthodox Funding"
  RWE_LIN_Elusive_War_Funding_desc:0 "The American alt-right has a long history with its involvement in organized crime, having its fingers in the old prison clans and the narcotics trade as a way to fund larger operations aiming to recruit people and destabilize the old Union. Those connections never went away and are now a potential avenue for Spencer and the Union of Lincoln to fund the war effort. By selling opioids in the Rockies and weed in California, the militias will be able to finally have their guns."

  RWE_LIN_Enemies_on_all_Sides:0 "Union under Siege"
  RWE_LIN_Enemies_on_all_Sides_desc:0 "We're surrounded by enemies on all sides: in the west the old alt-right reigns, not willing to change to the reality of 2010, foolishly holding onto the ideas of the 1930s. In the east, communists have cemented themselves on American soil, a product of Soviet imperialism in our fair nation. In the south, statelets of liberals continue to hold out, unwilling to realize that democracy has died with the Union. Up north, the Canadian menace breathes down America's neck, waiting to claim their spot from the old superpower. \n\nIf we do not win today, we won't survive tomorrow."

  lincoln.1.t:0 "Unification of the American Right"
  lincoln.1.d:0 "After a gruesome civil war that split the American right, our leader Richard Spencer has been able to unify the region under the new, alternative right-wing of national bolshevism, ending the split of the American right and crushing the traditional fascist order that led Montana. Under the Worker's Party, the Union of Lincoln will maintain the order in Montana and do away with any mention of the old traditionalists and fascists, replacing them with new and fresh ideas of revolutionary nationalism and national bolshevism."
  lincoln.1.a:0 "Lincoln would be proud!"
  lincoln.3.t:0 "Nation without a House"
  lincoln.3.d:0 "Since the end of the Midwestern experiment, Montana and Idaho became the staging grounds for the grand ideals of ethnostate. Attracting white right-wingers across the nation, this union between states born out of the failure of America would slowly experience more and more problems. Problems which the old men of fascism and nazism were unable to answer. Their old ideologies failed the nation and only one answer was left: national bolshevism. \n\nThe old ethnostate is now amidst civil war, with the traditionalists of Covington in Montana and the new third way of Spencer in Idaho-Lincoln. It will only be a matter of time before the conflict turns hot once more."
  lincoln.3.a:0 "A revolution is born?"
  lincoln.5.t:0 "New Lincoln Memorial"
  lincoln.5.d:0 "Today, Supreme Chief Spencer surprised the people of the Union by unveilling a new monument built in Spokane, named the New Lincoln Memorial. A 10 foot statue of the old president Lincoln, the statue not only embraces the name of Lincoln as the name of our state, but also expands on the legacy he left behind for the American people. According to the official government sources, Lincoln represents the American nationalist the best, fighting against the filthy Dixie and keeping the Union together. A fighter for the white worker, the statue also spits in the face of the mainstream depiction of the great hero according to Spencer and the one that made the statue, as those depictions embrace the Republican-Democrat Stateist conspiracy that forced the great American hero to free the slaves."
  lincoln.5.a:0 "Another expensive statue from our Supreme Leader"
  lincoln.6.t:0 "The All-American Worker"
  lincoln.6.d:0 "Today, bookstores across the union promoted the most recent book of famed white supremacist Kevin MacDonald. In his book \"The All-American Worker\", MacDonald argues that the American Dream has never true, due to it giving too much credit to immigrant workers compared to the white, protestant Anglo workers of the United States. In this book, which was actively sponsored and promoted by Spencer and the state, MacDonald argues that the US was built by white workers and that the true \"All-American Worker\" could only be defined by his white skin and non-semetic heritage. \n\nWhile the book itself has only seen limited release globally due to many nations banning it for hateful rethoric, MacDonald's new book has already gotten a cult following in the Union, especially among young party members."
  lincoln.6.a:0 "A surprising succes"
  lincoln.7.t:0 "The Commonwealth denounces Spencerite Marxism"
  lincoln.7.d:0 "The American People's Commonwealth has recently gone public in denouncing our \"perversion\" of marxist ideology and concepts. In an adress to the progressive and controlling media monopolies, [NEA.GetLeader] declared that our recent public interpretation of Marxism has done great harm to the true meaning of the ideology. [NEA.GetLeader] went on to publicly denounce this strain of \"Spencerite Marxism\", stating that it was simply fascism with a red coat. The Supreme Chief has already acted and banned the broadcasting of the denouncement nationwide, but a few of our communist allies have already caught wind of the news from east and have decided to swiftly abandon the national bolshevik cause."
  lincoln.7.a:0 "Big words from New England won't frighten us"
  lincoln.8.t:0 "Christian Exodus"
  lincoln.8.d:0 "Recent decisions made by the Workers' Party of the Glorious Union regarding the banning of public and private expression of religion has been met with dissaproval from a large section of the populace. Former allies of Spencer, especially on the Christian Right, have not been silent on their dissaproval of the new legislation. Tolerance for them did not exist, as many of these former allies were arrested, imprisoned and/or executed in a matter of days. \n\nThis recent purge has had its mental effect on large portions of our religious populace, leading to many fleeing the country in a desperate attempt to cling on to their archaic religion. Large droves of christians now reside in our neighboring states, having to survive in refugee camps. Other states have voiced their dissaproval of the Spencerite regime and its treatment of religion, but the Union of Lincoln has made it a point to not respond to these allegations or liberal propaganda."
  lincoln.8.a:0 "We won't bow down to the church"
  lincoln.9.t:0 "The Big Church Speech"
  lincoln.9.d:0 "This week's adress to the union of Supreme Chief Spencer has went differently than previous ones. While it started off relatively normal, Spencer's speech quickly took a turn when he stated his disgust with the \"Big Churches\", referring to every form of big, organized religion, including christianity, islam and judaism. While proclaiming his disgust for these big churches, Spencer also made clear what the citizens of the Union could expect in the coming weeks in terms of legislation. He promised several important pieces of law that would enable the state to actively fight against the threat of big, organized religion and \"desinfect\" those that have been loyal to these big churches in a matter of time. \n\nThe big church speech led to severe criticism from Spencer's christian allies in the Workers' Party and an official condemnation from the Vatican. Other states, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have opted to speak harshly about the Union, declaring this change in policy as another example of tyranny limiting civil rights. The Soviet Union and China have remained quiet on the issue, though diplomats from both nations have officially been sceptical about the intentions of the Union."
  lincoln.10.t:0 "A History of Revolutions"
  lincoln.10.d:0 "In his most recently published book, Supreme Chief Spencer tries to explain the fundamental concepts of national bolshevism. In this book, titled \"A History of Revolutions\", the Supreme Chief tries to break the basic concepts down in a way the common people can understand. Concepts such as historical determinism, racial realism, eugenics, socialism, marxism and fascism are explained. \n\nThe book has garnered incredible praise from the party, but critics outside of the Union have flamed Spencer's attempt at introducing national bolshevik concepts as \"too complex despite its audience\" and \"nothing more than a way to inflate Spencer's academic ego\". These critics don't matter however, as their opinions have already been silenced by the party's media team and the critics themselves have been put on a list of undesireable people."

  POLITICS_RICHARD_SPENCER_D:0 "Born in 1978 Boston, Massaschusetts, to ophthalmologists, few would have bet that Richard B. Spencer would become the face of the alternative right in Post-American politics. His introduction to the alt-right would begin early however, as contacts during his studying years would influence Spencer's views swiftly. Becoming a common face in anti-government extremist protests, Spencer choose to move to Illinois in 2001 before completing his PhD in Modern European intellectual history. \n\nOnce in Illinois, Spencer established connections with the underground alternative right, such as the National Alliance, which pointed him to Montana and the new ethnostate experiment led by Covington. Although intrigued by the concept, Spencer opposed Covington's old-style fascism, believing it to be unusable in the United States due to its Europeanism. Instead, he and allies formed an opposing party, named the Workers' Party of the Glorious Union, and seized control over Idaho. With the establishment of the new Union of Lincoln, Spencer became the figure of this new state and the new movement it represented, which Spencer has lovingly called American national bolshevism."
