  LIN_Cement_the_Leadership_Principle:0 "Cement Spenser's Leadership Principle"
  LIN_Cement_the_Leadership_Principle_desc:0 "One of the core tenets of the Workers' Party's revolution is the following: \n\n\"The revolution can only be accomplished by a vanguard. This vanguard can only lead the revolution if its led by a capable leader. Thus, the leader is the true revolution\"."
  LIN_Introduce_National_Bolshevism:0 "Introduce National Bolshevism"
  LIN_Introduce_National_Bolshevism_desc:0 "The roots of National Bolshevism are located in Eastern Europe, which has left the West without any truely important voices supporting this ideology. Especially Americans have remained ignorant about the glorious revolution. The Union is thus tasked with introducing the common American to National Bolshevism."
  LIN_Embrace_Horseshoe_Theory:0 "Embrace the Horseshoe"
  LIN_Embrace_Horseshoe_Theory_desc:0 "The horseshoe theory was once meant to protect the liberal status quo, calling the extreme right and extreme left alike and thus not really something revolutionary, deminishing the actual values of those ideologies. However, like many things, what was once meant to mock and demean will be turned into a sign of our struggle and victory. We will embrace the horseshoe as much as it embraces the revolution."
  LIN_The_Visionary_Marx:0 "Our Visionary Marx"
  LIN_The_Visionary_Marx_desc:0 "The writings of Karl Marx lay the foundation for the economically left-wing policies of the Union. While much of the original meaning of Marx has been twisted by Moscow, Beying and Berlin, Spokane will remain a stronghold for what Marx truely meant when he talked about revolution." 
  LIN_The_Messiah_Mussolini:0 "Our Messiah Mussolini"
  LIN_The_Messiah_Mussolini_desc:0 "The face of fascism, Benito Mussolini has laid the foundations upon which we stand today. A revolutionary to its core that embraces the true syncretic meaning of revolution and Marx's words, Mussolini is an idol to our Union and should be glorified by every man, woman and child."
  LIN_Crush_the_Peoples_Opium:0 "Collapse the Big Church"
  LIN_Crush_the_Peoples_Opium_desc:0 "Karl Marx once called religion the \"opium of the masses\". He was right. Religion and its soft morality distract the American people from the historical importance of this revolution. The Soft Influence of the Papal States in this Union should not be tolerated and a larger campaign should try and end religion in our nation."
  LIN_Strict_Government_Education:0 "Revolutionary Youth Education"
  LIN_Strict_Government_Education_desc:0 "Children are easy to mold into our ideals. Without a true grasp of the world and their innocence that allows them to believe anything that is told to them by an authority figure, children should become the true focus of our revolution. Education thus turns into a tool, namely the tool with which we mold these minds into revolutionaries."
  LIN_Ban_Anti_Revolutionary_Literature:0 "Establish \"Summer Camps\""
  LIN_Ban_Anti_Revolutionary_Literature_desc:0 "It has turned out that many Americans remain stubborn. Born during ages of democracy and liberalism, their minds have been rotted by these concepts of \"civil and political rights\". Thus, state-sponsored \"summer camps\" have been opened across the Rocky Mountains for adults that are deemed \"creative enough for camp\"."

  LIN_No_References_to_God_desc:0 "Supreme Chief Spencer has come to the conclusion that it's not enough for the big church to be removed from the United States of America. The threat of religion will remain if it's allowed to even be mentioned among our people. Thus, new laws will be put in place that criminalizes the spreading of religion, starting with mentioning the concept of God."
  LIN_Ban_Holy_Scriptures:0 "Ban any Holy Scripture"
  LIN_Ban_Holy_Scriptures_desc:0 "Every disease has its host and for the disease of religion, the holy scriptures are the hosts. A blanket ban on any form of supposedly holy scriptures has been introduced to the Union, banning the Bible, the Quran, the Torah and various other holy scriptures from being owned by any individual for non-government purpose."

  RWE_LIN_Fractured_Right_Wing:0 "Fractured Alt-Right"
  RWE_LIN_Fractured_Right_Wing_desc:0 "The American Alt-Right has, ironically, always been quite a diverse bunch of characters. Ranging from white-supremacists and neo-fascists to pagans and conspiracy theorists, the Alt-Right has never truely been unified behind one ideology. Despite the differences, however, many of these people did unify shortly after the failure of the American experiment, leaving their hometowns to support the creation of a white ethnostate in the north. \n\nThose memories have long been gone. The seccession of Montana from the Midwestern Union was a shortlived victory for the American Alt-Right, as factionalism fractioned the state. Many of the younger men that had rebuild in Montana weren't attracted by the old fascist rethoric of Covington, instead supporting new ideas imported from Europe and Canada, such as national bolshevism and its main proponent in Montana, Richard B. Spencer. Espousing a strictly American version of national bolshevism, Spencer was able to entice much of these younger alt-righters, leading to the fracturing of the Montana ethnostate. Allied to his left and right-wing allies, Spencer formed the Workers' Party and proclaimed a new dawn for the American alt-right, kickstarting the civil war in Montana."
  RWE_LIN_Ideological_Enigma:0 "An Ideological Enigma"
  RWE_LIN_Ideological_Enigma_desc:0 "Mixing Marxist theory, the teachings of Hitler, the philosophy of Mussolini and the government-style of Stalin, Richard Spencer's national bolshevism is an ideological enigma to most of America. \n\nThe introduction of a new, revolutionary ideology is never easy and Spencer's national bolshevism is the first of its ideological type to touch the shores of the former United States. However, unlike ideologies before it that ignited revolution after revolution, national bolshevism has many gaps in its theory, often leading to incoherent ideology and politics. That's not even mentioning the issue of allegiance to national bolshevism found in the Union of Lincoln, as the alt-right looks at it with paranoid disdain and the radical left denounces it as filthy nazism. With an incoherent ideology and few people actually aligned to the teachings preached by Richard Spencer, it's not an enigma why national bolshevism has yet to gain traction among the American populace."

  RWE_LIN_Christian_Exodus:0 "Christian Exodus"
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Exodus_desc:0 "Our harsh policy on religion has led to many on the christian right fleeing the Union of Lincoln, trying to find shelter in other states, even to communist, godless California. This exodus causes tremendous issues."
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Refugee_Camps:0 "Christian Refugee Camps"
  RWE_LIN_Christian_Refugee_Camps_desc:0 "The Union of Lincoln has recently cracked down upon all forms of religion, leading to a large-scale exodus of many religious people, especially former christian allies of the Spencerite regime. Fleeing persecution, many of them are forced to reside in large refugee camps on our border."

  RWE_LIN_Revolutionary_Determinism:0 "Spencerite Determinism"
  RWE_LIN_Revolutionary_Determinism_desc:0 "People seem to think that history is simply a series of events that happened by chance. History, to them, is nothing more than a gamble, a game of luck. They fail to understand that this simply isn't the case, as history has always walked the same, determined path towards revolution. Convinced that history is determined in favour of revolution, the Union has proclaimed Spencer the successor of the original founding fathers and his revolution the spiritual follow-up of the American Revolution."

  RWE_LIN_White_Socialism:0 "White Socialism"
  RWE_LIN_White_Socialism_desc:0 "The meaning of socialism has been hijacked by the Soviets, the American Communist Party and many other entities across the globe to mean something that supports the equality of races. Their use of the word is rejected by our wise supreme chief, who has chosen to introduce true socialism to America as part of the larger national bolshevik revolution. Socialism, but only for the white man."
  RWE_LIN_Statue_Costs:0 "Costs of the New Lincoln Memorial"
  RWE_LIN_Statue_Costs_desc:0 "Our great leader makes no mistakes, but the cost of the recently unveiled Lincoln memorial has made some party members question if the supreme chief is aware of the financial costs of his vanity projects."
  RWE_LIN_Surpressing_Creativity:0 "Surpressed Anti-State Creativity"
  RWE_LIN_Surpressing_Creativity_desc:0 "Creativity has become another one of those buzzwords used by democrats, progressives and liberals, sugercoating the reality. Creativity isn't something to strive for, but simply an annoyance to the people and the state. Some forms of creativity are even dangerous and are thus actively surpressed among the younger generations and the \"traditionally creative\" communities, such as the arts and academia."
  RWE_LIN_Inspired_by_Marx:0 "Twisting Marx's Words"
  RWE_LIN_Inspired_by_Marx_desc:0 "A specter is haunting Europe, the specter of communism. \n\nMarx never meant this as a positive. His words actively warned the great thinkers of those times of the coming Russian storm.

  RWE_LIN_Religious_Crackdown:0 "Collapsing the Big Church"
  RWE_LIN_Religious_Crackdown_desc:0 "Once something that unified the white American people against non-whites, christianity has turned into something despicable according to supreme chief Spencer.

Those connections never went away and are now a potential avenue for Spencer and the Union of Lincoln to fund the war effort.

  RWE_LIN_Enemies_on_all_Sides:0 "Union under Siege"
  RWE_LIN_Enemies_on_all_Sides_desc:0 "We're surrounded by enemies on all sides: in the west the old alt-right reigns, not willing to change to the reality of 2010, foolishly holding onto the ideas of the 1930s. In the east, communists have cemented themselves on American soil, a product of Soviet imperialism in our fair nation. In the south, statelets of liberals continue to hold out, unwilling to realize that democracy has died with the Union. Up north, the Canadian menace breathes down America's neck, waiting to claim their spot from the old superpower. \n\nIf we do not win today, we won't survive tomorrow."

  RWE_LIN_Nation_on_the_Edge:0 "An Union on Edge"
  RWE_LIN_Nation_on_the_Edge_desc:0 "The American Union State is currently walking on a tight rope above the abyss. Spencer's post-unification speech has been the lit match to start a chain reaction across the country, as many old supporters have turned their back against the increasingly tyrannical regime he has founded. Cooperating with those they once hated and fought against, this new opposition has pushed the union on the brink of collapse. While the streets of NYC are overrun by protestors and the streets of Atlanta have become a battleground, Spencer has turned inwards with the task of purifying the Workers' Party, forging something that will never oppose him again. \n\n§RWe're starting to stare into the dark abyss.

Socialists fight alongside fascists while new democrats tend to the wounds of conservatives in this war, as we only have one shot to save democracy. \n\n§GLet's make that shot count!§!"
  RWE_USA_Corporate_Allies:0 "Corporate Allies"
  RWE_USA_Corporate_Allies_desc:0 "The recent situation has made some strange bedfellows these last months, as big corporations that once dominated their homestates have seek refuge under the banner of the USA against the Spencerite revolution. Big corporations that spread throughout America prior to the collapse, such as McDonald's, Starbucks and Dole Food Company, favour our government over the national bolsheviks and have made big agreements with it to support the current war effort. Contracts signed between the companies and the government guarantee a steady supply of food to the troops and citizens in our territory for as long as the war lasts, buying us some much-needed stability and morale as the national bolsheviks start to mobiize for war."

Ideals that were once widespread in the Hellenic world, such as bravery and being strong, have been forgotten by the old libertarians.

  lincoln.1.d:0 "After a gruesome civil war that split the American right, our leader Richard Spencer has been able to unify the region under the new, alternative right-wing of national bolshevism, ending the split of the American right and crushing the traditional fascist order that led Montana. Under the Worker's Party, the Union of Lincoln will maintain the order in Montana and do away with any mention of the old traditionalists and fascists, replacing them with new and fresh ideas of revolutionary nationalism and national bolshevism."

  lincoln.3.t:0 "Nation without a House"
  lincoln.3.d:0 "Since the end of the Midwestern experiment, Montana and Idaho became the staging grounds for the grand ideals of ethnostate. Attracting white right-wingers across the nation, this union between states born out of the failure of America would slowly experience more and more problems. Problems which the old men of fascism and nazism were unable to answer. Their old ideologies failed the nation and only one answer was left: national bolshevism. \n\nThe old ethnostate is now amidst civil war, with the traditionalists of Covington in Montana and the new third way of Spencer in Idaho-Lincoln. It will only be a matter of time before the conflict turns hot once more."

A 10 foot statue of the old president Lincoln, the statue not only embraces the name of Lincoln as the name of our state, but also expands on the legacy he left behind for the American people. According to the official government sources, Lincoln represents the American nationalist the best, fighting against the filthy Dixie and keeping the Union together. A fighter for the white worker, the statue also spits in the face of the mainstream depiction of the great hero according to Spencer and the one that made the statue, as those depictions embrace the Republican-Democrat Stateist conspiracy that forced the great American hero to free the slaves."
  lincoln.5.a:0 "Another expensive statue from our Supreme Leader"
  lincoln.6.t:0 "The All-American Worker"
  lincoln.6.d:0 "Today, bookstores across the union promoted the most recent book of famed white supremacist Kevin MacDonald. In his book \"The All-American Worker\", MacDonald argues that the American Dream has never true, due to it giving too much credit to immigrant workers compared to the white, protestant Anglo workers of the United States. In this book, which was actively sponsored and promoted by Spencer and the state, MacDonald argues that the US was built by white workers and that the true \"All-American Worker\" could only be defined by his white skin and non-semetic heritage. \n\nWhile the book itself has only seen limited release globally due to many nations banning it for hateful rethoric, MacDonald's new book has already gotten a cult following in the Union, especially among young party members."
  lincoln.6.a:0 "A surprising succes"
  lincoln.7.t:0 "The Commonwealth denounces Spencerite Marxism"
  lincoln.7.d:0 "The American People's Commonwealth has recently gone public in denouncing our \"perversion\" of marxist ideology and concepts. In an adress to the progressive and controlling media monopolies, [NEA.GetLeader] declared that our recent public interpretation of Marxism has done great harm to the true meaning of the ideology. [NEA.GetLeader] went on to publicly denounce this strain of \"Spencerite Marxism\", stating that it was simply fascism with a red coat. The Supreme Chief has already acted and banned the broadcasting of the denouncement nationwide, but a few of our communist allies have already caught wind of the news from east and have decided to swiftly abandon the national bolshevik cause."
  lincoln.7.a:0 "Big words from New England won't frighten us"
  lincoln.8.t:0 "Christian Exodus"
  lincoln.8.d:0 "Recent decisions made by the Workers' Party of the Glorious Union regarding the banning of public and private expression of religion has been met with dissaproval from a large section of the populace. Former allies of Spencer, especially on the Christian Right, have not been silent on their dissaproval of the new legislation. Tolerance for them did not exist, as many of these former allies were arrested, imprisoned and/or executed in a matter of days. \n\nThis recent purge has had its mental effect on large portions of our religious populace, leading to many fleeing the country in a desperate attempt to cling on to their archaic religion. Large droves of christians now reside in our neighboring states, having to survive in refugee camps. Other states have voiced their dissaproval of the Spencerite regime and its treatment of religion, but the Union of Lincoln has made it a point to not respond to these allegations or liberal propaganda."
  lincoln.8.a:0 "We won't bow down to the church"
  lincoln.9.t:0 "The Big Church Speech"
  lincoln.9.d:0 "This week's adress to the union of Supreme Chief Spencer has went differently than previous ones. While it started off relatively normal, Spencer's speech quickly took a turn when he stated his disgust with the \"Big Churches\", referring to every form of big, organized religion, including christianity, islam and judaism. While proclaiming his disgust for these big churches, Spencer also made clear what the citizens of the Union could expect in the coming weeks in terms of legislation. He promised several important pieces of law that would enable the state to actively fight against the threat of big, organized religion and \"desinfect\" those that have been loyal to these big churches in a matter of time. \n\nThe big church speech led to severe criticism from Spencer's christian allies in the Workers' Party and an official condemnation from the Vatican. Other states, such as the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada have opted to speak harshly about the Union, declaring this change in policy as another example of tyranny limiting civil rights. The Soviet Union and China have remained quiet on the issue, though diplomats from both nations have officially been sceptical about the intentions of the Union."
  lincoln.10.t:0 "A History of Revolutions"
  lincoln.10.d:0 "In his most recently published book, Supreme Chief Spencer tries to explain the fundamental concepts of national bolshevism. In this book, titled \"A History of Revolutions\", the Supreme Chief tries to break the basic concepts down in a way the common people can understand. Concepts such as historical determinism, racial realism, eugenics, socialism, marxism and fascism are explained. \n\nThe book has garnered incredible praise from the party, but critics outside of the Union have flamed Spencer's attempt at introducing national bolshevik concepts as \"too complex despite its audience\" and \"nothing more than a way to inflate Spencer's academic ego\". These critics don't matter however, as their opinions have already been silenced by the party's media team and the critics themselves have been put on a list of undesireable people."
  lincoln.10.a:0 "Everyone's a critic these days!" 
  lincoln.11.t:0 "Revisionism against the Mainstream"
  lincoln.11.d:0 "New schoolbooks have recently been distributed across large parts of the Union of Lincoln, replacing the old schoolbooks from the Reagan era that were still in use. These new schoolbooks on history have taken quite the different approach to the subject compared to the older books, with the books painting clear emotional and political opinions on many big American figures. Men like FDR and Wilson, once glorified by the mainstream, are depicted as war criminals in these new books, involving themselves with European affairs and sacrificing innocent Americans for their own legacy. Presidents after Vietnam are often vilified by the books, depicting them as weak imperialists, unable to truely realize the tides of history leading to their failure and the eventual collapse of the United States. \n\nInternational organizations tasked with keeping tabs on the quality of global education have voiced serious concerns about the new textbooks, calling them pieces of propaganda not unlike the schoolbooks used in Korea. Their interpretation of events have been denied by the Workers' Party and pieces of media about the textbooks are currently being monitored by the party's media team."
  lincoln.11.a:0 "Books are great tools"

  lincoln.14.t:0 "The War against the Deep State"
  lincoln.14.d:0 "\"We've been mere tools to the people that formerly governed the United States of America. Tools for the socialist elite, trying to surpress the freedom-lovers and gun-owners since the inception of America. Today, we stand against these people and declare a holy war, for America wills it\". \n\nLive broadcasts of our awakened shaman were seen across the disunited states. While many have signed him off as a lunatic, more powerfull people have started to notice and have quietly come to the same conclusion: this man, instilling fear and paranoia into the American people, is nothing more or less than a domestic terrorist, willing to lie and create scapegoats as long as he stays in power."
  lincoln.14.a:0 "And so, the American crusaders awaken!"
  lincoln.15.t:0 "One Hour of Awakening"
  lincoln.15.d:0 "A recent decree from Spokane has mandated all forms of media to dedicate at least one hour every day to government advertisement. This hour, known by the people as the \"Hour of Awakening\", gives the government the opportunity to share with the people their newest conspiracy theories, mandated by the Awakened Shaman himself and his clique of truth-knowers. Unafraid to tell the people the truth, this hour per day hopes to instill the people with the fear of the global elite, awaiting their time to strike."
  lincoln.15.a:0 "It's not propaganda if it's true!"
  lincoln.16.t:0 "The Shaman from the South"
  lincoln.16.d:0 "Mere hours after the chaos in Spokane, members of the unorganized militias outside of the city have flocked to the elusive and enigmatic man, known only as the Awakaned Shaman. After the collapse of the Union of Lincoln, the Shaman has claimed to have seen the future of America in his dreams. He warns the people that listen of the threats of Spencerite ideology and its followers, it being an extension of the conspiracy against the American people. America, he claims, is littered with enemies of Americanism. From the communists and minorities to the national bolsheviks and federalists, the nation has been torn apart through a globalist conspiracy perpetrated by Soviet spies. \n\nWhile his claims are, at best, absolutely bonkers to many people, the shaman has been able to gain a sizeable, armed following and, with the current chaos in Spokane, has had his eyes on securing the city for himself, ending the corrupt regime of Spencer and its anti-American conspiracy to replace it with a new order of post-truth awakening, one that sees the world for what it truely is and rejects the naive outlook of those before the shaman, for the shaman knows best."
  lincoln.16.a:0 "America is surrounded"
  lincoln.17.t:0 "The Place to Be"
  lincoln.17.d:0 "Our recent liberalization of the old substance laws has had some interesting consequences, mainly turning the Free Roman Territory into a drug tourist heaven. People from across the United States and Canada dare to cross the border into our lawless territories for that sweet relief given to them by our locally produced weeth, meth, LSD, shrooms and much, much more. Some people are even brave enough to stay, living their high life (quite literally) in a rural house in the mountains of the territory, blowing away and teaching their children the great values of their rights, mainly their right to be high and blow whatever they want. \n\nWhile a great boost to the local economy, due to our lack of a tax system, Augustus won't see a dime in taxes from this new reputation."
  lincoln.17.a:0 "A place to be, a place to blow"
  lincoln.18.t:0 "David Lane's Milita"
  lincoln.18.d:0 "A previously prominent member of the Workers' Party, David Lane has split with the party line and the state by forming his very own militia near the Utah border. Known as the People of the Temple, this militia doesn't poses a serious threat to the government at this point, but their existence isn't the problem. The main problem is the formation of this militia without the expressed permission of the government, something that hadn't been done previously. While voices are raised about detaining Lane for his crime against state order, these are not taken seriously, as Lane and his militia are not on the grid and thus impossible to find."
  lincoln.18.a:0 "A damn shame..." 
  lincoln.19.t:0 "The Augustus Opposition"
  lincoln.19.d:0 "In a manifesto delivered to Spokane this weekend, a former member of the party known only as Augustus Sol Invictus has declared the Spokane regime an illegal occupation movement of sovereign Americans. In the manifesto, he has informed us about the formation of a new rebel movement, which he himself has called the \"Grand Liberation Movement of Free, Sovereign Citizens\". While the Ministry of State Security has been unable to compile a complete list of information about this new organisation, they have tracked down Augustus Invictus to his last known position, namely a barn in the middle of Montana. It has been assumed that Augustus has the support of previous Covington-loyalists and libertarian-minded comrades, allowing the formation of a small coalition of white supremacist libertarians unhappy with the Spencerite government."
  lincoln.19.a:0 "Quite the story..." 
  lincoln.20.t:0 "The Spokane Bombing"
  lincoln.20.d:0 "As the situation has become increasingly unstable in the Union of Lincoln, a bombing has taken place in the heart of our pure nation. Our parliament has been damaged by libertarian suicide-bombers, injuring hundreds and killing a handfull, which include a member of the House. Spencer himself has fled the capital during the chaos that followed, as the previously loyal militias now seemed to get tense and demanded reassurance from the Lincoln government. While they're waving their guns around the House of the People, Spencer is preparing for the civil war to come."
  lincoln.20.a:0 "It's inevitable at this point..." 
  lincoln.21.t:0 "Start of the Militia Wars"
  lincoln.21.d:0 "As Spencer and the government have rallied the troops after hours of radio silence, the damage done to our ever stronger union has been shown. The periphery of our nation is occupied by anti-government forces and cultists, espousing ideas of libertarianism, wotansvolk and conspiracy-ism. While our boots march to Spokane once again, we are reminded of what our great task is in this war: the cleansing of our union from those that cannot understand the necessity of the revolution."
  lincoln.21.a:0 "May the revolution prevail" 

  lincolnpost.1.t:0 "An End of the Old"
  lincolnpost.1.d:0 "Adressing the entire nation of America for the first time in decades, Supreme Chief and First Among Equals Richard B. Spencer would become the first man to \"represent\" all Americans since president Reagan. While he would personally adress just a small crowd at the capital of [Root.Capital.GetName] in the grand unification celebration, TV crews friendly to the state would ensure that millions of Americans with acces to the luxury of television would experience the same speech, may they be in Florida or Oregon. \n\nIn his speech, the Supreme Chief celebrated the unification of America as the first step of the new national bolshevik revolution. Praising the revolution as an end to the old and a start of the new, Spencer's speech would swiftly take a turn. Celebration made place for paranoia as the Supreme Chief started to go through every percieved enemy of the revolution: the religious, the ex-Republicans, the old fascists, the members of the KKK, the ex-Communists, the progressives, the old Democrats, the African-American community, the Asian-American community, the Hispanic community, those that previously worked for the other states and more. As he continued to go down his list, excluding any reasoning for why he had chosen these people, Americans across the nation started to realize the potential implications. As Spencer finally finished with his list of enemies of the revolution, the nation was already up in arms. Protestors in the Black belt, the Rust belt and the Bible belt were already on the streets before the speech had ended, while the urban populace was also preparing for the worst. \n\nAt the end of his speech, Spencer would face the small crowd of people that were still celebrating, with many of the previous men and women present in the crowd having gone home. He would later be informed by the Union's secret police that the speech had led to an inflamatory reaction across the Union, as many old supporters and those that had remained silent had turned against the Union. \n\n\"Just like I said in my speech\", the Supreme Chief mumbled."

  POLITICS_RICHARD_SPENCER_D:0 "Born in 1978 Boston, Massaschusetts, to ophthalmologists, few would have bet that Richard B. Spencer would become the face of the alternative right in Post-American politics. His introduction to the alt-right would begin early however, as contacts during his studying years would influence Spencer's views swiftly. Becoming a common face in anti-government extremist protests, Spencer choose to move to Illinois in 2001 before completing his PhD in Modern European intellectual history. \n\nOnce in Illinois, Spencer established connections with the underground alternative right, such as the National Alliance, which pointed him to Montana and the new ethnostate experiment led by Covington. Although intrigued by the concept, Spencer opposed Covington's old-style fascism, believing it to be unusable in the United States due to its Europeanism. Instead, he and allies formed an opposing party, named the Workers' Party of the Glorious Union, and seized control over Idaho. With the establishment of the new Union of Lincoln, Spencer became the figure of this new state and the new movement it represented, which Spencer has lovingly called American national bolshevism."
  POLITICS_RICHARD_SPENCER_D_II:0 "From a small rump state in the former state of Lincoln to the de facto unifier of the American continent, Richard B. Spencer has come a long way. Once compared to the mad dictators of old, screaming in the mountains about a fringe ideology, Spencer has brought national bolshevism to the people, if they like it or not. \n\nWith the continental United States under his iron thumb, Spencer looks inwards, hoping to perfect the new National Union and take the next step in the revolution by expansion. The national bolshevik revolution may not know any borders, but it's most important goal at this point is preserving Spencer and the party, as without it, the revolution would be a bull without its head. Measures will be made to keep the national security a priority above everything, while large industrialization projects will hopefully kickstart a new American war economy, set in motion for the glory of the people's revolution. \n\nSpencer has conquered much, and he will conquer more if needed."
