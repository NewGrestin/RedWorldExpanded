  RWE_Gulf_Coast_Alliance_Leader:0 "§YLeader§! of the Gulf States Pact for Mutual Defense"
  RWE_Gulf_Coast_Alliance_Leader_desc:0 "The Invasion of Kuwait in the 1970s was a wake-up call to the states of the Arabian Gulf. Seeing the Kuwaitis brutally toppled and oppressed under the Ba'athist boot compelled the government in Riyadh to begin building diplomatic ties with their neighboring Arab nations. The fruit of this initiative was the Gulf States Pact for Mutual Defense, an unofficial alliance between Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar and the Union of Arab States. The far-left government of the Union was a point of contention in the alliance, although it was ultimately decided that the greater threat lied with Iraq or the United Arab Republic.\n\nIn contemporary times, the GSPMD or Gulf States Pact serves the dual purpose of a regional economic bloc and mutual defensive alliance. Though the Gulf States continue to bicker, they remain at least nominally united in their efforts to keep Saddam's ambitions under control.\n\nShould Hussein's Iraq choose to strike South, the Gulf States will fight until victory is achieved, or they will §Rmake him pay for every inch§!"

  RWE_Taliban_Insurgency:0 "The Secret Insurgency"
  RWE_Taliban_Insurgency_desc:0 "On paper, Afghanistan has embraced the Soviet model of Marxism-Leninism and embraced their place as a loyal ally in the Warsaw Pact. This story is sold to the world as best as it can, because the reality of the Afghan situation is far less charming. While the Soviet Union maintains a nominal military force in the country, domestic and international commitments have gradually drawn the Red Army towards other areas. The Afghanization of the military peacekeeping mission, while not entirely a failure, has failed to resolve the looming issue of anti-communist resistance.\n\nThe geography of Afghanistan and its' relative isolation from the international community has allowed the forces of the Taliban to remain a controlled, but persistent, problem. While certainly not as brazen as they were during Soviet operations, the Taliban's capacity for terrorism and general mayhem remains a problem.\n\nThe central government has refused to acknowledge the issue, claiming that the Taliban and anti-communist resistance groups were soundly defeated, and any evidence to the contrary is a fabrication."
