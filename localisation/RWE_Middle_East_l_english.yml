  RWE_Gulf_Coast_Alliance_Leader:0 "§YLeader§! of the Gulf States Pact for Mutual Defense"
  RWE_Gulf_Coast_Alliance_Leader_desc:0 "The Invasion of Kuwait in the 1970s was a wake-up call to the states of the Arabian Gulf. Seeing the Kuwaitis brutally toppled and oppressed under the Ba'athist boot compelled the government in Riyadh to begin building diplomatic ties with their neighboring Arab nations. The fruit of this initiative was the Gulf States Pact for Mutual Defense, an unofficial alliance between Saudi Arabia, the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar and the Union of Arab States. The far-left government of the Union was a point of contention in the alliance, although it was ultimately decided that the greater threat lied with Iraq or the United Arab Republic.\n\nIn contemporary times, the GSPMD or Gulf States Pact serves the dual purpose of a regional economic bloc and mutual defensive alliance. Though the Gulf States continue to bicker, they remain at least nominally united in their efforts to keep Saddam's ambitions under control.\n\nShould Hussein's Iraq choose to strike South, the Gulf States will fight until victory is achieved, or they will §Rmake him pay for every inch§!"

  RWE_Taliban_Insurgency:0 "The Secret Insurgency"
  RWE_Taliban_Insurgency_desc:0 "On paper, Afghanistan has embraced the Soviet model of Marxism-Leninism and embraced their place as a loyal ally in the Warsaw Pact. This story is sold to the world as best as it can, because the reality of the Afghan situation is far less charming. While the Soviet Union maintains a nominal military force in the country, domestic and international commitments have gradually drawn the Red Army towards other areas. The Afghanization of the military peacekeeping mission, while not entirely a failure, has failed to resolve the looming issue of anti-communist resistance.\n\nThe geography of Afghanistan and its' relative isolation from the international community has allowed the forces of the Taliban to remain a controlled, but persistent, problem. While certainly not as brazen as they were during Soviet operations, the Taliban's capacity for terrorism and general mayhem remains a problem.\n\nThe central government has refused to acknowledge the issue, claiming that the Taliban and anti-communist resistance groups were soundly defeated, and any evidence to the contrary is a fabrication."

  newsrw.60.t:0 "Jihadists overthrow Saudi Government"
  newsrw.60.d:0 "Just months after the Saudi monarchy has been overthrown by pro-Soviet insiders of the House of Saud, the former Saudi kingdom has experienced another violent revolution that has overthrown the new communist regime of Talal Al Saud. This pan-islamist \"Liberation Movement\", headed by wealthy Saudi jihadist Osama Bin Laden, conspired with the anti-communist opposition and the Ulema against the government due to its anti-religious ambitions and close relationship with the Soviet Union. \n\nIn an adress to the Saudi press, Bin Laden stated that the coup was morally justified due to the extreme situation in Saudi Arabia. During it, he criticized the old monarchy and the free princes of \"bowing down to foreign influence\" in its friendly foreign policy to the old USA and Soviet Union, proclaiming that both are part of a larger international conspiracy against islam. Citing his experience in the Afghan war, Bin Laden vowed that he would not rest before the Soviet world order would break and the muslim people would be unified under one caliphate."

  newsrw.61.t:0 "Saudi Sultan under House Arrest"
  newsrw.61.d:0 "The unstable government of Saudi Arabia, after refusing to commit to reforming the archaic institutions of the state, has been overthrown by reformist-minded princes in the Saudi royal family. This group of \"Free Princes\", under Talil bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, has put the sultan under house arrest with support of the military and has proclaimed a start to intense reform of the Saudi monarchy. \n\nFormed by Talil Al Saud in the image of the Nasserist Free Officers Movement in Egypt, the Free Princes Movement has been a force in the house of Saud for a rather long time. They've pushed the monarchy to reform its institutions and shift towards a more Soviet-friendly foreign policy, often facing the influence of the conservative Ulema. While the movement's influence was able to convince the Sultan of establishing a more powerful parliament, the monarch remained the absolute ruler of Saudi Arabia, leading to pro-democratic protests this summer. Convinced that they had the support of the people and the army, Talil's Free Princes overthrew the sultan."

  newsrw.62.d:0 "In response to the recent military incursion of the Atlanta government into Texas, the OPEC international cartel has come together and agreed to embargo the American Republic for the duration of the war. \n\nIn a response to the international press, OPEC made it clear that it sought \"the unilateral withdrawal of Atlanta troops out of Texas and the end of hostility towards the Texan state\". In a further elaboration by the diplomat representing the Saudi government, OPEC was of the opinion that \"oil, the fuel of the modern war machine, spoke louder than words\", and that \"the embargo will send a clear message to the government in Atlanta: making international enemies will only further isolate the American Republic on the global stage\". \n\nAtlanta has not yet responded to the embargo or the OPEC statement."

  RWE_OPEC:0 "OPEC"
  RWE_OPEC_desc:0 "\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablished in 1960 by Saudi-Arabia, Venezeula, Iran, Iraq and Kuwait, the OPEC has since then grown to become one of the most powerful international economic organizations in the world, rivaling the European Union and Warsaw Pact in sheer economic soft power. Through their combined power, the OPEC members are able to influence the price of oil through setting production and export quotas, allowing them to maximize the profit gained from their black gold and putting political pressure on international rivals when needed. Since the 1960s, the OPEC has expanded to include countries like Angola, Nigeria, Algeria, Libya and Gabon, leading to the OPEC formally controlling almost 80% of the global oil supply. \n\nHowever, the OPEC isn't as unified as other international organizations of its power. With an intense ideological difference between Venezuela, Saudi-Arabia and Iran, the OPEC members often find themselves at odds with eachother. The unity of the OPEC is thus needed to effectively influence the oil prices and put economic pressure on the global north. Having high OPEC unity in times of crisis may even mean that we can §Rshut down the international oil market and cause global upheaval, though this may not come without a price§!. \n\nHaving low OPEC unity may come due to individual countries not following the quotas set by the OPEC countries and, if OPEC unity is too low, may cause §Rthe collapse of the international cartel, putting us in a vulernable position to the global powers§!. \n\n§YOPEC Quotas§!: [?OPEC_oil_production|0.%] \n\n§YOPEC unity§!: [?OPEC_unity|0.%]"
