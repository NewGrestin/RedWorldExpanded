  RWE_JAP_Sick_Democracy:0 "Symptoms of a Sick Democracy"
  RWE_JAP_Sick_Democracy_desc:0 "Since the end of the American occupation of Japan, one party has consistently dominated the National Diet and Japanese politics with it: the Liberal Democratic Party. Popular among many layers of Japanese society, ranging from farmers to the housewives, the LDP has maintained its dominant position for 60 years at this point, with few breaks between these long stretches of LDP government. Even the biggest opposition party in Japan, the Communist Party, has been unable to win the election against the Gadaffi-like marges the LDP gets in national elections. \n\nYet the situation has changed a lot since the early Cold War. The collapse of the United States would put a big dent in the Japanese economy, one that would be followed up by the '90s asset bubble crisis. This \"Lost Decade\" of economic crisis would reinvigorate the Communist Party of Japan and shake up the cemented position of the LDP. The fall of the United States forced the party to take a far more right-wing and nationalistic stance as the liberal world order had proven to have failed. \n\nToday, the democracy that is Japan is very ill. Electoral reform was needed to keep the LDP far ahead of the JCP and trust in the government is reaching lower and lower records. Tamogami will have to lead Japan through turbulent times, as the many problems the nation faces will have to be solved eventually."

  RWE_JAP_Echoes_of_the_Lost_Decade_desc:0 "When the United States of America fell, the people of Japan could feel it: not in their hearts, but in their wallets. As the United States crumbled, so did the Tokyo Stock Exchange. The price we had to pay for the failures of the liberal world order were simply too high for the country to bear and, as the LDP grappled with combatting the issues brought on by an era of economic stagnation, the opposition profited from the salarymen that lost their jobs, the housewives that lost their husbands or the students that lost their future. \n\nSince the fall of the US, the Japanese economy has grown only 1% in terms of GDP annually, while real wages have fallen around 5% compared to their '80s counterparts. Price levels have stagnated and economic inequality has grown. To combat the crisis, Japan has put on a staggering amount of debt, yet the Lost Decades march on. As 2010 rolls around, Japan still sits in this shallow pool of economic stagnation and no real perspective for the future. We can only watch as our rivals in East Asia, such as Korea, China, Vietnam and India all experience economic growth we can now only dream off. An enormous effort will need to be made if we are ever to pick up Japan from this lake of financial regret."

  newsrw.35.t:0 "Anthrax Epidemic hits Japan"
  newsrw.35.d:0 "News from Japan has shocked the world and has forced governments across the globe to swiftly react with precautionary measures, as an anthrax epidemic has hit the heart of Japan, Tokyo. Already, 15.200 cases have been reported across the metropolitan area, with another few thousand expected to follow in the coming week. The city council of Tokyo has already responded with a temporary lockdown of the city and affected areas, with hospitals running overtime to combat the infection. \n\nThe cause of the incident is hotly contested at this point in time, with many suspecting it to be a bioterrorist attack against the Japanese state. However, evidence remains scarce currently, with the priority of the government being the finding, containing and treating of the affected. While anthrax isn't as infective as many other infections, people are still advised to not share a space with infected patients."
