RWE_MAS_return_of_the_massachusetts_machine_desc:0 "In the mid 1950's, Senator John Kennedy was shot by a lone gunman in New York. The death of the senator became a major sensation, and it threw the prominent Masschusetts family into the public eye even further. John's younger brother, Robert "Bobby" Kennedy lamented his late brother, and proceeded to enter further into politics, running for his brother's senate seat. The angry young man arranged a plan: create an anti-communist Democratic bloc of Senators, to rival the sitting Southern bloc. Unfortunately for Kennedy, his plan never spread very far out of Massachusetts. Millions of dollars of Kennedy money swept into political candidacies across the state. As the fifties became the sixties, Bobby began to get presidential aspirations, and almost achieved his goal, before being felled by a gunman much as his brother was.\n\nThis left his brother Edward. Edward Kennedy proceeded to shore up machine control of Massachusetts, and did so throughout the seventies. As America fell apart, the Massachusetts machine cracked, as strong political movements in neighbouring Vermont caused the defeat of a Democratic senator in place of an incumbent.\n\nThe Kennedy machine broke for good as the American People's Commonwealth was established. However, the Kennedies continued to fund democratic movements in New England for thirty years, and their chance arrived. Landing in Boston, Joe Kennedy II declared the return of democracy to Massachusetts.\n\nThe question is, will the new machine be able to withstand the remnants of Socialism?"

RWE_MAS_the_sanders_vacuum_desc:0 "The truth about Bernard Sanders hit nowhere harder than New England. As Sanders' political movement died at it's highest moment, mass resignations, assassinations, riots and general chaos hit the states of Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. As the states appeared to be completely under Sanders' control, there appears to be a massive power vacuum circling the new statelet, and no one knows what will fill it in these three states."

RWE_MAS_canadian_money_desc:0 "The "Commonwealth of New England" in essence does not exist. Control is hazy everywhere outside of Boston, but what it does have is money. Money from the Kennedys, but also plenty of Canadian intelligence dark money. The goals that Canada has for the statelet are unclear, but the only thing that we can be sure of is that they will expect to be paid back, in either blood or cold hard cash."
