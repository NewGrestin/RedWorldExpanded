  arab_islamic_republic.29.t:0 "Libyan Truth and Reconciliation Committee"
  arab_islamic_republic.29.d:0 "The fall of the Gadaffi regime and the ensuing civil war tore Libya apart, exacerbating political divides across our entire society and decimating the country. As the Libyan Provisional Government continues to rebuild, the issue of what to do with the Loyalists has been brought up. In an effort to appear humane, the Government of National Accord established a Truth and Reconciliation Committee to prosecute elements of Gadaffi's regime. The crimes involved have been heavily publicized, ranging from extrajudicial mass murder to embezzlement.\n\nWhile the most obvious solution would be to simply execute all those involved, as there is more than enough evidence to hand out thousands of convictions, doing so might be too extreme. The alternative is to simply imprison those involved, allowing them to work for the new democratic government in a way most suiting Gadaffi's cronies. Offering amnesty to some of the convicted would do well to earn us the support of the pro-Gadaffi western provinces, but the wounds of the civil war may be too raw for the public to support such an action."
  arab_islamic_republic.29.a:0 "Execute the captured Loyalists"
  arab_islamic_republic.29.b:0 "Life in prison is more than enough"
  arab_islamic_republic.29.c:0 "Amnesty is the first pillar of reconstruction"
