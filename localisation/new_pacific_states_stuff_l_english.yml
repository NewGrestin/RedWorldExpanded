 PCAnew.1.t:0 "The Saturday Night Massacre"

 pacific_america.365.t:1 "Presidential Election"
 pacific_america.365.d:1 "In accordance with the transitional government's call for a presidential election as soon as possible, the day has finally come for Americans to vote for their next leader. With just four weeks of campaigning since the shocking resignation of the Politburo, three candidates have risen in opinion polling to become almost neck and neck. Julia Nixon Eisenhower is the daughter of the deceased president of the United States of America Richard Nixon, who flew over from the American Republic to represent her place of birth in the election underneath the "New Republican" banner. Clint Eastwood, the veteran actor and briefly Californian Senator before the Great Collapse, won the nomination of the American Freedom Party. Considered a 'libertarian', Eastwood claims to represent Americans that are unhappy with the traditional left-right spectrum, and wishes to unite the country after its 'darkest times'. Kevin de Leon formed his own party - the Star Alliance - not long before the election, calling for a progressive agenda combined with less far-reaching economic reforms than his opponents. The latter position has alienated de Leon from many left of center voters, but endeared him to many other millions."
