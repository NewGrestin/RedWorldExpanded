The Taiwan branch of this party represents a strange blend of the political vanguardism of the KMT Right with the social democratic elements of the Left, while simultaneously championing the legacy of Chiang and Sun Yat-sen. This element of the party remains extremely small due to their reconciliatory stance towards the People's Republic, leading to allegations of being a faction of Quislings."
